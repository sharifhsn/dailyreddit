      "I don't think he needed to leave Phoenix at all tbh. He was already proving he was an absolutely elite role player on a contender, which I think still is and probably always will be his peak/best fit. I don't think he's able to be the guy on a really good team, and that's fine. His defense is one of his greatest strengths, and the more load he's forced to carry on offense, the less he can expend on that elite defense. Imo he should be going for a Jrue Holiday like career which is still an absolute success for anyone.\n",

      "Hes actually so bad they'll probably fire him and he'll get to go home and collect the paychecks lol. Genius\n",
      "He's trying to get fired. Made his money and doesn't wanna spend the next 6 years working. Get fired in a year or two and have fun retired with 70 mill\n",
      "I’ll never understand how coaches get these guaranteed pay if fired contracts. Really makes no sense.\n",
      "It's really no different to waiving a player with a guaranteed contract\n",
      "That rarely happens to big money player contracts though because they still go against the salary cap.\n",
      "I know, my point was that guaranteed money is guaranteed money regardless of whether it's a player or a coach.  Also if the rumours of them really struggling to attract any other candidates is true, they may not have really had a choice but to guarantee the whole thing\n",
      "But it’s not the same thing. High contract players don’t just get cut. The money will be on the books and you can’t replace the player. If anything they get traded. Harden is the perfect example…….he’s been a pain for three straight teams but they trade him where he wants to go because they can’t cut him.\n",
      "I don't think I understand the point you're making then, all I was saying is that coaches having guaranteed contracts isn't that bizarre since guaranteed contracts are the standard for attracting top level talent, be that a coach or a player ( not that Monty is a top level talent lol).\n",
      "Because you have to pay that coach for the 5-6 years he’s not coaching anymore. A high contract player doesn’t just get cut and paid because that contract still goes against the cap. If anything he gets traded and you keep a portion of the contract. That’s the difference. What other job do you get paid to not do your job for years because you’re bad at it. CEO bonuses I guess.\n",
      "Ah I get you. I suppose the answer is that a lot of teams are incompetently run and sign coaches based on vague reputation rather than talent or fit. In this specific case, I imagine what I mentioned earlier about them struggling to find a coach prior was a factor too. Also, if an owner is willing/absurdly wealthy enough to eat the cost of a failed coaches contract, they may consider it a worthwhile risk (which I think is probably just another way to say \"incompetence\" lol)\n",

That's how many coaches out there that are bad.  Coaches also don't count against the cap. There's basically no reason to cheap out with them.\n",
      "I’m not questioning paying a coach well but if you sign someone to a 10 year deal and fire them after 4-5 years they shouldn’t get paid for 5 more years. It’s the same in NFL and NCAA football. It’s ridiculous…..now NBA coaches don’t usually leave mid contract but NCAA coaches leave all the time to take other jobs no penalty but you fire them and still got to pay. Makes no sense.\n",

The owners get 50% and the players get 50%. So say the NBA makes 30 Billion, then each team gets 1 Billion. 500 million goes towards the owners which is usually invested back into the team and a smaller amount paid out to the stakeholders. The other 500 is used to pay the players and forms the benchmark of the salary cap.\n",
      "They give money to the owners, not specifically to pay for the players salary. That's just revenue sharing it has nothing to do with expenses. The revenue sharing with the players is done so through the creation of a higher salary cap, no? Not through direct payments to the players.  Owners can do whatever they want with the revenue sharing, including paying for better coaching, in the end, the expenses on an income statement still show coaches salary and players salary as the same type of expense. If a team has a lower salary for players, the owner is making more money, right? Not like they have to pay out the difference as long as they are over the floor.\n",

      "For sure, no way he's outright fired since he has such a long time left on his deal. They would keep him onboard in some capacity as leverage if he wants to work elsewhere.  Celtics refused to fire Udoka for similar reasons, and I think he ultimately gave up the remainder of his owed salary in exchange for being released from his contract and allowed to coach the Rockets.\n",
      "I believe this is inaccurate with regard to Udoka. They had enough supporting evidence to fire him for cause, which would have allowed them an out against the remaining years. They kept him on because there was potential for a lawsuit and they wanted the same legal team to be able to represent both the organization and him.\n",

      "> What would probably happen if they decided to replace Monty is to move him to a FO position  Technically they can't \"move\" him.  You can't sort of take someone contract for doing one job and just move it over to another job. They can offer him a change of position, and if they offer that to him and he accepts, great, but it would be up to him.  If he isn't interested in a FO job then they'd be in the same situation, pay him to coach or pay him not to coach.  >They would basically make him a consultant with no responsibilities whatsoever and might get assigned to scouting in a really low level league  Critically, he'd have to accept that change of position, and he has all the leverage.  He can continue to get paid by the Pistons and go coach some college program rather than be relegated to some kind of scouting assignment.  His contract will be very explicit that he's the head coach, a company doesn't have the ability to shuffle employees around like that, and of course the NBA coaches have a union, which further restricts job actions.\n",

      "yeah, but you have to pay players salary. there's a mandatory minimum. you don't have to pay a coach that and its not really an asset you can swap, like players picks etc. The team is just stuck either paying the contract or buying it out.

      "For the most part this is correct, but coaches can be traded. Doc Rivers is a pretty famous example of this, as he was traded to the Clippers for a first round pick. Anything can be an asset if the person is valuable enough, but that doesn't really apply here.\n",
      "That is an interesting thought; how many assets would they have to attach to get rid of the contract? Like to the Clippers, that contract is still fun money you find under the couch; so would they take like Detroit's next three second round picks and a few pick swaps to take Monty on as a guy that comes into the office and watches tape sometimes?\n",
      "Presumably, he'd need to sign off, and you'd also need an organization that wants him. Also, it probably depends on the language of his contract, but I'd wager that changing his role would take some re-negotiation.\n",

Why is there one veteran on the team, and why was he at best the 3rd best player on a team that never made the conference finals?  The roster sucks and makes zero sense.\n",

      "I don’t think anyone is going to argue Monty is doing a good job.  I’m sure there are a number of coaches who could have this roster and not having one of the worst losing streaks ever.  But I don’t think any coach would get more than 15 wins out of this team this season.\n",
      "I’m just saying I would cut bait w Monty ASAP not that there’s any redeeming qualities about this team don’t get me wrong lol   We hated Casey but it’s comical to watch Monty do even worse w essentially the same team. At least Casey brought in CoJo, and while I hated watching him dribble the air out of the basketball, he was an adult who could pop off for 20 pts and run an offense\n",
      "The issue is Monty has proven he can be a competent coach, even with an imperfect roster in Phoenix (especially before the CP3 trade).  The roster is fundamentally broken to the point it’s hard to evaluate whether it’s worth eating $75 million on his contract.    The GM needs to be replaced for sure.  Next year Detroit needs to bring in competent pieces and cut bait on a bunch of players.  Then you can really gauge whether it’s worth eating 55+ million to get a new coach.\n",
      "That’s a fair way to look at it and it’s not realistic to eat that 70 mil anyways   But it’s not my money and I don’t think competency is worth waiting years for. Especially not w a guy like Monty who has a history of alienating players. If you’re going to do that you better win before everyone hates you. He’s not going to do that in time here so I just think waiting on him will be a waste of time and wind up in a Cade trade down the road\n",

      "Sometimes a guy in a ceasing situation just runs its course. Teams start tuning the coach out, and it's not a reflection on the coach.   Larry Bird retired as a coach after 3 incredibly successful years partly because he felt that was around how long a team would listen to a guy.\n",
      "That's true, but that was his personal style and preference.  The Jazz ran it back for 10 years with Stockton, Malone, and Sloan before making the finals.  Spoelstra has been successful in Miami for a long time, in part, because he was able to help set up a culture and a system.  I think most front offices are usually pretty quick to pull the trigger on a coach after one (maybe two) disappointing season(s) with high expectations.\n",

      "I absolutely agree with you but I will say Monty is a coach in which I feel like most people agree deserved a 2nd chance somewhere. Helped build the culture with the Suns, especially with that 7-0 bubble run. The next season got to the finals. Had the #1 seed but then choked the the Mavs, a bad series doesn’t deserve firing. Then the Suns trade for KD which most people feel was a mistake at this point and no one was beating the Nuggets.   So I get why the Pistons went after Monty to coach their team, he was the coach there that got PHX from picking #1 to the finals. How much was him is up in the air and he did show a lack of playoff adjustments the past 2 years but he’s supposed to be that development coach.\n",
      "3rd chance. He was the HC of the Pelicans for 5 years and didn’t accomplish much there either.\n",

      "A couple of things:  1. Monty was looking to take a break after the Suns. His leverage wasn't other teams clamoring for him, it was him saying he'd rather just take a break  2. Monty helped the Suns turn the team from a league joke to a team that made the finals. He's not the best coach in the league, but that resume is very attractive to a perennial lottery team   3. Coaching a bad team is a huge risk that can destroy someone's career. If Monty doesn't turn the Pistons around, he won't be getting another HC job any time soon. I don't think any coach at Montys level wanted to take on that risk without a high price  These things together make the contract make sense IMO\n",

Even before CP3 got there the Suns were chasing the playoffs and had that 7-0 bubble run. The next season they went to the finals.

Under 10 wins for the season is indicative a total rebuild is needed in the whole organization. Everything needs to be looked at. Players, coaches, scouting, front office, back office, ownership, mascot, arena, sponsorships, concessions, apparel.   At this point, I want the team to be stripped to the bones and start over.

      "Doesn’t matter too much this year particularly. This is one of those drafts where the best player will probably be drafted after 5 because there is absolutely zero sure fire picks.   And trust me, the Pistons don’t need more top picks. They need real NBA players to surround the top picks on the roster that are having their growth stunted by being surrounded by guys who have no business getting rotational minutes in the NBA. They are not going to draft their way out of this shit hole. If it was that easy; they would have done it already.

      "Coaching is VASTLY overrated by NBA fans. There was a paper at MIT Sloan back in 2018 that investigated “how much does coaching matter?” For the NBA, going to an absolute bottom tier coach, worst of the worst, to the absolute best of the best coach (2 standard deviations below the mean to 2 std above the mean) would net you 14 wins per year. The issue is that nobody is doing that. Your typical team making a “good coaching change” is probably going from a subpar coach to a slightly above subpar coach, which is worth *maybe* 4wins per season.

The Spurs are terrible, it’s not because Pop is a terrible coach.      I wish fans understood this when they scream to fire a coach. Because doing so very rarely makes a sizeable difference.

They are easy for fans to dream about because feasibly all it takes is the owners willing to take a financial hit to make a change.

KD didn’t want to go to Minny and there’s was nothing that they could’ve offered to willingly get him there. My point is that a package like that is something you offer to a team that’s giving you a superstar or a fringe superstar player and Gobert is at best a fringe all star level player who gets in due to his defensive prowess, and as much as we like to prop up defense in basketball offense will ALWAYS be more important and more valuable in basketball because they aim of the game is to get the ball in the basket. An elite scorer who can carry an offense will always be more valuable than a player who can block shots and it clearly shows in players contracts. Besides, who else were the Wolves competing with for Gobert to give up 5 1rdp and multiple quality rotational players? It was a bad trade because the wolves gave up double of what they should’ve for a player who doesn’t guarantee them success.\n",

      "The only way giving up that many assets for a player will be worth it is if they come out of it with a ring. Anything else, and it's a mega bad trade.  Nets gave up Bogans (gone from the NBA the next year), Brooks (left the league the first time in '14), Humphries (fell out of the league in '17), Joseph (gone from the NBA the next year), Wallace (retired after '15), 3 firsts and a swap for Garnett and Pierce. Basically, the Nets gave up 2 players who never played another NBA game after that season, another player that fell out the league the end of the season before coming back a few years later, a guy who retired next season, and one journeyman, along with three picks and a swap.  The Wolves gave up Beaseley (with the Bucks now), Beverley (76ers), Vanderbilt (Lakers), Bolmaro (out of the league), and Kessler (Jazz), plus 4 picks and a swap, so on paper, they already gave up better players (4 are still in the league after 1 year, as opposed to just 2 in the other trade) and still more draft picks, so unless the Wolves in the big one, it might still end up being the worse trade.  \"You gave up four decent players and four picks and a swap, and for what? At least in the case of the Nets, they only gave up one decent player and Gerald Wallace on his last legs plus three firsts and a swap.\"\n",
      "Didn’t read all this, gonna say it’s not going to be as bad as the nets giving up Tatum and Brown for not even 1 year of washed up KG and Pierce.\n",
      "> gonna say it’s not going to be as bad as the nets giving up Tatum and Brown for not even 1 year of washed up KG and Pierce.  I mean, if Tatum and Brown never win a championship with the Celtics and the Celtics don't flip them into assets that eventually bring them a championship, I don't really think so.  To me, the only thing t hat should matter to a team is winning a championship. Anything other than that is a failure, and there's no degrees of failure, so unless they flip assets into other assets that land them a championship, it's kind of a wash. To repeat that more simply: ***only*** championships matter, nothing else, and Tatum and Brown haven't brought that to the Celtics yet.\n",
      "That’s a terrible way to look at things. A decade plus of 50+ wins on the back of that duo is absolutely worth a ton.   Are you saying James harden to the rockets wasn’t a good trade because they never won a title?\n",
      "> A decade plus of 50+ wins on the back of that duo is absolutely worth a ton.  I guess you and I value different things, then. I value winning the big one, especially when the regular season is just an extended pre-season nowadays anyways. So, to me, a 50+ win season with no championship is not that different than a tanking season: the team didn't win the only prize that matters.  Given this, I judge two trades that don't net their teams championships to have the same end value.  Also, I purposefully didn't list the Celtic duo as part of the Nets/Celtics trade because, if those picks had stayed in the Nets hands, there's no guarantee they'd have taken those players. The Nets might have screwed up those picks, the way teams screw up picks all the time, and even if they picked the same players, they could have screwed up their development as teams are wont to do all the time, so, as far as judging the trade is concerned, the picks are picks.   If anybody should be given credit for the Tatum and Brown picks and their development, it's the Celtics front office and coaching staff, but that's credit for the Celtics, not the Nets.  > Are you saying James harden to the rockets wasn’t a good trade because they never won a title?  The Rockets traded Kevin Martin (played 4 years after Rockets), Jeremy Lamb (played a decade in the NBA) and two first and a second for Harden, Aldrich (out of the league after 6 years), Cook (fell out of the league immediately) and Hayward (fell out of the league after a year). Neither team has won a championship yet after the trade, so, the end result is equal; however, the Rockets got the best player out of the trade (Harden developed into an MVP after joining them), so it was a good trade for them.  Basically, to put it back in terms of the Wolves/Jazz trade compared to the Nets/Celtics, if neither team ever wins a title based on the assets on this trade, then I'll judge it on who got the best player going forward, not counting draft picks since the original team may not have made the same picks. Basically, it'd come down to whether Gobert turned out to be a better player for the Wolves than  Garnett and Pierce, compared to what they had to give up, and I've already established that, for a year of two washed-up talents, the Nets gave up two scrubs, a journeyman and an old dude, compared to the Wolves giving up four guys who are currently still in the league and one more first-round pick. Basically, it comes down to whether the significantly higher opportunity cost will be worth what Gobert gives them compared to what Garnett & Pierce barely gave the Nets for much less.\n",

Talent is clearly not enough to win in the NBA, and a guy who can consistently get teams to 50 wins and the second round of the playoffs does know a thing or two.  Discourse today defines coaches as either elite, or awful. No room for nuance. People called coach Bud terrible for years but he got the bucks their first championship in forever.

      "Heard the same about the sixers when they lost all those games. None of that really played out at all though, we started winning games when Joel Embiid showed up and have been a top seed ever since.  I’ve watched the 15/16 sixers and that 7 win Bobcats team in addition to this years Pistons. It’s really not much different, at least the Pistons HAVE someone to build around for the future.  Everyone in that org is doing a bad job rn, it doesn’t mean they’ve ruined the next 5 years already\n",
      "That’s because the 76ers got to add Embiid and Ben Simmons right after who were 2 immediate all-star level players. Even still Brett Brown got fired anyway cuz they kept choking in the playoffs. Pistons are very unlikely to get that lucky and Cade Cunningham has a lot of flaws in his game and shoots inefficiently. The Bobcats are a good example of what can happen because that franchise has been mediocre/bad since that terrible losing season, had like 2 first round exits as the peak of success and most of their drafted players didn’t amount to much.\n",
      "I’m sorry I’m a bit confused here? Could the pistons not draft #1 next season and add an elite player next to Cade just like the sixers were able to?  My point is that this isn’t a death sentence at all, and Brett Brown’s time in Philly through the rebuild overall was a success. He came up short in tbe playoffs, but it wasn’t because we were bad in 15/16, like it had almost nothing to do with those seasons by 17/18 when we went in to win 50 games.  Cade is a fantastic player, he’s got no spacing and has had a year long injury. I think he’s absolutely a guy you can build around long term, with drafting and developing some other talent. You’re projecting far too much IMO about what they will be based on this season. I’m sure many projected the sixers to suck for a decade after the 15/16 season, but that didn’t happen\n",

This roster is garbage, but it’s better than last years roster, who didn’t perform nearly as bad until post asb when they started sitting everyone.    That’s not even getting into his hilariously clueless press conferences, his ever changing starting lineups, his 11 man rotations with 5 man bench lineups even after he said he was going to shorten the rotation, or his insistence on starting Killian Hayes to disastrous results until the FO stepped in/Hayes got injured.\n",

      "We’re less than 30 games into his first season coaching a team that is a dumpster fire of a roster. I know people dislike the suns (me too) and Monty by extension, but let’s not forget he did spearhead one of the biggest single season turnarounds ever w that young squad so he does have some coaching ability.   We’ll see how it plays out but I think it’s unfair to not give him at least 2-3 years to see what he can do with the team as the roster hopefully improves\n",

No clue why you're arguing so hard especially since you're wrong. When practical works fine there's no need to CGI, it's literally some of the best shooters in history making some midrange buckets on timing.  So lmao or whatever?\n",

      "That Bulls team was still really good outside of just Rose. I remember during the season Rose was out, the Bulls without Rose spoiled the Heat's chance at breaking the 71/72 Lakers' record for most consecutive wins and they did it with Carlos Boozer, Luol Deng, a young Jimmy Butler, Nate Robinson, Kirk Hinrich (who drew what felt like 4 charges in that game), and Nazr Mohammed.   On paper that obviously isn't that impressive of a roster, but at the time they were a defensively stout platoon of guys who would grind you down while also putting up points on the other end. They were by far my favorite team in the league at that time that weren't the Kings.  Thibs gets shit on a lot for a lot of things, but it was so damn impressive how he was able to keep those Bulls teams afloat after D-Rose got hurt, missed tons of time, and then obviously lost a step. The only more impressive job I can remember in recent history was Brad Stevens with the 2018 Celtics after Gordon Hayward went down for the season in the first game and Kyrie was in and out of the lineup constantly.\n",

      "Not sure, it’s a pretty dead breed _ there’s still a couple stars of that lineage like Siakam or Randle, but otherwise not much.  The issue is this pace and space era needs you to have no more than one non-shooter on the court, and almost any contender would much rather have the flexibility to play 5-out. The mid-range back then *was* considered spacing, but it’s just a different game now.  Post play is significantly less popular as well and most “PFs” are expected to space from behind the line which in turn decreases their interior presence as a rebounder. They tend to be a lot smaller as well, which decreases their shot-blocking frequency.\n",

Jokic, Embiid, Lopez are the same but bigger. Maybe Lively, Allen, Gaf, Gobert, Zu, Clax, Capela, Poetl, Biyombo, Looney, Robinson (role players) still play like a center.

      "Bam is a great example bc he is 6'9, an elite defender inside and on the perimeter, has handles and can create his own shot, and has a nice mid range. But he's been firmly a center every season. He would 100% be a PF in any other era. (And a damn good one).\n",
      "True, but he's the same height as Larry Bird. He could also have played 3 in an earlier era when 3s weren't required to shoot 3s, and weren't required to guard guys like morant or SGA on the perimeter.  It's equally correct to say Bam is bigger than most 3s of an earlier era, and more skilled than 4/5s.\n",

      "i think its the traditional center position that is dead. AD, Sabonis, Sengun, Wemby/Zach, Chet, Vuc, Bam, Jonas, KP/Horford, Turner, Nurk, Ayton all play like PF. occasional post up, standing in the midrange and shooting occasional 3s. Jokic, Embiid, Lopez are the same but bigger. Maybe Lively, Allen, Gaf, Gobert, Zu, Clax, Capela, Poetl, Biyombo, Looney, Robinson (role players) still play like a center.   Also no one just stands around under the basket (except in the playoffs or some defensive scheme) now, since switching is a thing so most \"centers\" guard the perimeter or roam, again this is more of a PF thing than solid rim protection in the past.  in terms of defense and shot selection i think most centers nowadays are closer to the PFs of the past than Centers.\n",
      "Im of the same opinion. True centers are reserved for rotation minutes nowadays or for certain matchups. The classic defensive role of a center is alive enough but offensively its most just double PF. Unless there is a huge mismatch at the center position then you can see people like AD just play a classic center just because those jumpers become inefficient  Like jokic could play like a classic center to great success if he wanted to but its just worse than how he plays now.\n",

      "I don’t think we’re going back to two low post bigs clogging the paint on offense, unless there are significant rule changes that force strategy changes. There’s just too much efficiency lost playing that way, instead of focusing on layups and 3s.   I do think we’ll see a lot more 3pt shooting centers like Chet, which allows you to play a PF as the roll man / dunker. For example, Aaron Gordon can get most of his points in the paint without clogging things up, because Jokic has so much gravity on the perimeter both as a shooter and a passer.   So instead of PF/C on offense, it’s more like spacing big / rim-running big.   I’d also add most of the 2000s PFs you mentioned had great face up games. But at that time with Shaq in the league, they all had to prioritize playing as bulky as they could to contribute defensively. The game was very slow in that era and focused on half court execution. I’m not saying Webber would’ve been exactly like Giannis, but I do think he could’ve played skinnier and been more of an attacker if he had played in a pace-and-space era.\n",

      "The Center position will always be there because it provides a defensive anchor in the paint. The game has evolved beyond the need of a traditional power forward because of math, more or less. You're still seeing that same style of play now, but it starts at the 3 point line. Guys like Zion/Siakam/etc are still using their larger frames to play bully ball to attack the rim or take mid range shots, they just hang out at the 3 point line for floor spacing. Guys like Duncan/Garnett/etc (some of which are debatably centers) had similiar offensive games, they just hung out inside the 3 point area. That's really the only difference.   I'd also argue the center position never really left the game. Teams have always had a rim protector. When Dwight was declining, you still had guys like Cousins/Jonas Valenciunas/AD/The Gasol bros/etc _ maybe there was a bit of a gap in terms of who you would build a team around but it's not like everyone went small ball for years until we got some heavy hitters at the center position. Fact is height is such a huge advantage in basketball, it's just a matter of time before we are seeing teams full of guys like Wembi/Chet as human beings are evolving to be taller/more athletic through genetics/nutrition.\n",

      "I've been a basketball player and fan for a couple decades and still can't really tell you what the difference between a power forward and a center with more mobility and skills is. If your 7 footer can dribble and make moves from the elbow and shoot threes why would you just park them under the net all game?\n",

      "Most of the best power forwards were not traditional.  Barkley could have an offense ran through him, Duncan and Garnett were like centers but athletic enough to play the 4, Dirk and Webber were floor spacers.  In today’s NBA, Giannis, Davis (more of a center now), Sabonis (more of a center now too but shouldn’t be), and Zion (if healthy) are the best “traditional” power forwards but still do things the aforementioned greats did (pass and dribble, shoot, and rim protect) to take qualities of point guards, wings, and centers.\n",

      "Roster dependant.  Wemby will most likely benefit from a true power forward because he's a 3 level scoring center. So an old school PF works next to him.   In general big men haven't gone anywhere, they've just expanded their skill set because coaches at the high school and AAU levels aren't forcing to only play on the block. The players were always capable but the coaches and plays were too cookie cutter.\n",

      "I think centers came back because our definition of center is a little looser, you just gotta be the big guy on the floor and the primary rim protector. What they do besides that has changed a lot, but they're still big guys who play near the rim on defense.  PFs role was all about being a secondary post player, on offense and defense (usually in the high post instead of the low part), with a dash of being a bruising enforcer. With the death of double post offenses, I just don't see \"traditional\" PFs coming back ever, though I also feel like KG with his Swiss army defense and playmaking package is really the prototype for the modern point forward big more than he is in line with the traditional 80's/90's 4, so the change has been going on for awhile.\n",

      "You can trade injured players, it's just that the other team needs to be fully informed of the injury and the team getting them has to agree on the diagnosis and that they are in fact getting an injured player. And clearing waivers is only for waved players, not for injured players being traded.   Clearing waivers is if a team waves a player then every other team has a day or two to decide whether to just pick up their contract as is (which can be done without the agreement of the player). If nobody does that, they they \"clear waivers\" then the team that waved them is on the hook for their full contract, and the player is now free to sign a new contract with any other team that offers them one.\n",

Normally small guys struggle there but Brunson is absolutely elite he’s super strong closing n he has this post game n bag that makes him so hard to guard especially in the clutch.  Brunson n kyrie the two best post plsying guards in the league: if Brunson was better defensively I’d prefer him closing over many other higher ranked taller guys. Knicjs hsve randle too\n",

      "That’s pretty misleading. Bird rights allow you to go over the salary cap when resigning a player. It’s what they’re talking about when they talk about teams needing to sign free agents with their cap space before extending players with whom they have bird rights.  You can’t go over the cap signing free agents, only with bird rights, and exceptions (tax payer midlevel, and … shit… the cheapest one, whatever it’s called… biannual?)\n",

      "Finals series? I guess. But it was 9 games over 2 years and Steph was better in 3/4 games in 2018. Take away his awful Game 3, and his numbers are absolutepy better. But a 4 game sample exaggerates single bad performances.  But Steph had a better overall 2017 playoff run. It was not *CLEARLY* KD. Especially given the fact defences keyed in on Steph and he took a larger playmaking role for it.\n",
      "> Take away his awful Game 3, and his numbers are absolutepy better.  Yes, let's take away a Game he almost lost by himself in an NBA Finals series and that KD had to pull off one of the greatest performances in Finals  history to carry him, that makes alot of sense.  > But Steph had a better overall 2017 playoff run.  He didn't. Durant was the better scorer and rebounder while being more efficient and was a GREAT defender during his time in Golden State, it's almost like yall don't watch the games and only believe in narratives thrown in r/nba.\n",
      "And all that to secure a sweep instead of a gentleman's sweep? It's not a CARRY if a loss has zero bearing on how that series was going to end up.   And you want the 2017 playoff numbers? You apparently ONLY bare about rebounding and PPG, but news flash: there's more to it.  Steph: 28/6/7/2 on 66 TS%  KD: 28/8/4/1 on 68 TS%  Basically, similar scoring numbers, KD slightly more efficient but Steph clearly a better playmaker. Steph also did it facing more double teams and teams schemed defensively around *him* _ not KD. Especially that Finals, where Ty Lue openly acknowledged it.\n",

      "1. Lebron woulda never went back if he wasn't originally drafted there. He's said so himself, that returning was a big deal  2. Steph is definitely more impactful to the warriors rings than KD is. He won before and after KD, while KD hasn't accomplished anything.

      "For your first point… I don’t see how that’s relevant to the discussion as I understood it. I didn’t think we were talking abt emotional weight of championships or why best players ended up in places. I thought it was pointing out the importance of good drafting over other team building measures.  Also… he was born there too. So it seems like there’s probably some interplay between being drafted and being born there.  For Steph… everything your talking abt feels like sentimental legacy stuff, not who was the best player on two specific teams. I mean I know I didn’t offer much either, but at least I can point to FMVPs, which just so happens to be my entire original counter argument, guess I did that on purpose lol. And as someone else said… neither seem like the “locker room leader” I mean for Steph everyone literally always says that’s draymonds job.   For the last part, your sounding kinda naive. People pick data to support or discredit arguments. My problem was that by having the two proceeding years that would disagree cut off and silently deciding that lebrons messy situation in Cleveland counted in his favor, the facts felt visibly bent instead of subtly manipulated. Also why would ten years show a better trend then 12? As someone with something of a stats background, unless I’m trying to pick a message I’d always rather have more data to better define trends and when they change.  And to be fair my counter argument also willfully manipulated the narrative. 12 is as arbitrary as 10 and the two years proceeding go against my argument. If I wanted to make a better argument I might specify that we’re starting in 2011 with the decision and the beginning of the era of player movement and going with FMVP because best can be a nebulas concept so I’ll rely and the official nba voters to decide who the most important player on a title team is. By the way, this comes out 8 of the last 13 FMVPs not being on their original run with the team that drafted them.\n",

      "Almost everything you mentioned is tangential to the original point. The reason a player ended up there, who the locker room leader may or may not be, and OP cherry picking a volume set doesn’t take away that this trend picked up in the times of player movement.    Otherwise, let’s just look at 2020-21 onward, call it 100%, and pretend the league wasn’t HEAVILY impacted by player movement, resulting in a ton of changes to the cba.    Only teams that have a good chance (have what many consider a top 10 player along with believable title hopes this year) to continue this trend would be LAL, LAC, Phx. A 20% experimental probability when only 10% of teams meet the criteria (6% for those that have Booker>kd) is noteworthy. Expanding another 2 years back making it a 58% experimental probability is extremely noteworthy. This is very much why we have the supermax and new salary cap rules to incentivize giannis, Jokic, Embiid, Luka, etc staying put.\n",

      "‘Kd hasn’t accomplished anything .’ I just know people saying this are nephews . Kd has lots of playoff succes n and a mvp and was widely viewed as second only to Lebron fuckibg James for a long ass time . Even post serious injuries sapped of athleticism he kept himself in top 3-10. If you’re gonna say that kd has nothing then you might as well say Steph only accomplished one ring in 22. That’s just as dumb Like there’s no consistency. Go back and actually rewatched 2017 finals and/or look at the numbers . Kd was definitely superior to Steph there by some distance n don’t give me grabity nonsense because kd has huge gravity himself and the team had better offensive n defensive rating eith kd then with Steph . Kd also closed out game 3 when cavs went cold with an explosion that prevented that series from going to 2-2 into g5. Despite stephs so called super powers . I know people like to rewrite the narrative too much on kd and I’m a Bron fan so it’s not like I love kd n hate Steph I respect them bith but it is bizarre how you can be the number one option , be the guy they all recruited , gave Draymond say they couldn’t do it without him , close out 2017 game 3, and FAR out play curry vs the rockets the only times that team was under pressure 17-18  kd was the better guy in both occasions. Kd eas the guy they gave the ball too . At worst it shoukd be equal credit for that . Steph accomplishments can be minimised like kds too and it would be equally dumb : like kd didn’t take the thunder to regular season n playoff success and not have shitty injury luck n barely fail .  Steph culture n leadership is the most over rated in the league and I actually have nothing but respect for his game but Draymond n pools situation alone , along euth his team plays shows Draymond is the emotional n vocal leader of that team . Steph is more like kd or Kawhi then a Lebron Kobe n mj who is a huge presence . It’s the warriors culture n leadership Steph is a part of thst but bizarre to give him credit for it entirely . Steph is a better offensive engine sure but kd atleast when they played together is a better give ball n take us to win guy. Stephs improved in that area from 21/22.\n",

It's for sure true that free agents love great markets and teams, but how much does it really affect the league?  It's really mostly been lebron in this century   Most teams aquire their best players through the draft or trades.  Don't get me wrong, the last decade or so has seen some big fa signings shift the league like lebron and KD but it's super rare.  And it's not even \"big markets\" so much as it's good teams.  Miami is a small city.  Gsw were a joke for decades and nobody wanted to be there til curry came around. It didn't have much to do with the city at all imo.  Long story short, major free agent signings shifting the league are pretty rare.  It's number 3 behind drafting and trades. It's just the thing that makes headlines and is easy for the media to write about   \"Denver drafts eastern European center with 2nd round pick and wins\" doesn't draw eyes.  \"Lebron leaves Cleveland and signs with Miami\" gets people burning jerseys\n",
      "It’s not “big markets” it’s “glamour markets.”  I’m sure you can see how Miami and the Bay Area following the tech boom would be appealing for NBA players.\n",
      "which free agents wanted Golden State before they were good?     Nobody wants to go to terrible teams regardless of market. The Knicks and Bulls rarely get anyone.     Miami is a great destination, but also a great franchise. If they were the Kings or something, nobody would want to play there.     My point is that it's oversimplified in NBA media when people say \"free agents want glamour or big markets\".     The quality of the team/franchise matters more. The one exception recently was lebron signing in LA when they weren't good, but he did that knowing they were getting AD.\n",
      "Bulls aren’t really a glamor market— they’re a big market, which I would say proves the distinction. The Nets got three stars recently by simply being in New York.  There are plenty of well-run organizations that don’t ever figure into the mix for prominent free agents. Spurs, OKC, Milwaukee just to name a few.\n",

That, coupled with 1) expanding your volume set by 2 years adds another 2 teams that don’t meet your criteria, and 2) ignoring the leagues criteria for who the best player is (kd over curry for those 2 titles) _ this narrative fails to grasp the impact of player movement and all the efforts that went in to stop it a couple years ago.\n",

But yeah kind of a pointless point to make about Embid.  I feel like the usage one was intresting, but more so for Jokic than Embid (to me at least) as it showed the way Jokic plays against teams vs Embid, which honestly isnt a negative for either player.  But this is really pointless.  Like id imagine most players would miss more away games than home games.  Hell cant even blame a guy for wanting to stay at home instead of traveling for work (id do the same if i was him tbh).\n",
      "Jokic is a pass first player, that’s his “fastball”. Bad teams struggle at taking away a players “fastball”. Better teams take this away first, which causes him to go to his secondary pitch if we’re staying with the baseball metaphor lol which is scoring. Embiids fastball is his scoring, so that’s what teams try and take away first. I feel like this is all pretty intuitive, but I guess it’s always good to get the numbers that back up what you see.\n",

Assists increase usage and since embid is a weaker passer they try to keep Him away from Scoring but jokic is more playmaking leaning so teams don’t scheme to Limit his individual usage as much .

      "1) you don't compare the home and away record with embiid to the without. You completely ignore the control. 2) you don't compare to other players A) other star players sitting out home vs away. Is embiid doing anything different from other stars? B) win/loss impact of them sitting out home and away. Is the difference unusual or normal.   Ie you only look at a single data set and don't even compare it to a control. You don't compare it to other players, to see if this is normal or unusual.   Your conclusion is what you wanted it to be after a cursory look at a sub section of the data. This isn't analysis. It's trash. It's not insightful, and it ignores context of any kind.\n",
      "1. I will do that analysis tomorrow, but expect even MORE insults when providing the context :) 2. This is a vague request. What is a 'star' player to you? Should I analyze the 24 'All-Star's? Or just the MVPs (Giannis, Jokic, Embiid) over that period of time? I'd argue the MVPs because they're clearly a level above the rest, and we're comparing the current best players here.  I'll do the analysis, but I'd like to hear what your hunch is that the data will show. Do you think Embiid sits more or less than the other two?\n",
      "Yes doing actual analysis vs a hater dumb post will no doubt get a worse response 🙄  I'd expect Joel misses more game. I expect the home and away splits will be relatively similar as will the win loss impacts.  If proven true the conclusion would be that Joel is no different just misses more games. Which would be not very informative.   But it might not be, and then it might actually be interesting information.   The fact you have been defending your analysis until now and then say \"oh yeah I'm doing more this is totally incomplete\" is funny though.\n",
      "I wrote about an hour ago I’m going to do more tomorrow, my guy. I never said this is incomplete, either. It was complete in what I wanted to show (a simple analysis). You have asked for additional criteria here, which I’ve agreed to provide.  If I provide the additional criteria, you’d call it complete, until someone else asks for more _ in which case it’s incomplete again, right? I am genuinely curious if you asked for more criteria in all the Jokic hate posts last season that took the sub by storm, or if those simple analysis were good enough?\n",
      "My only reply to jokic hate was a dumb joke. Which way too many people up voted.  All my other replies to the entire debate are always that both jokic and embiid are amazing and we don't need to crap on the other player to support the other. Obviously I want embiid to win MVP as I support the sixers. I'm not mad if jokic wins and I certainly don't have to put him down to support Joel. I hate the culture of claiming an excellent player is bad to get your guy ahead. Honestly, I hate the culture of ripping down players period.  As for the analysis the fact you ever thought it was complete or meaningful in any way is disqualifing especially considering your claims of being an expert data handler in relation life.  Do whatever the f you want tbh. If you post something interesting or insightful then hopefully you'll get better responses but doing shit analysis with an agenda and defending it as unbiased because it's data is seriously sad stuff. If you actually work with data you know people can make it say what they want if they choose to.\n",
      "The analysis was sufficient in the aim to start a conversation.  Ah, now it’s “do whatever you want” when you know how easily the rest of the data could be pulled tomorrow. Ok.  Enjoy your Christmas and don’t take posts on Reddit so seriously :) Joel is an amazing player too, top 3 in the NBA.\n",
      "Yeah because I don't have any expectations for your analysis because you defended this as competent analysis repeatedly in the thread, even getting very defensive about it.  It's nice you're changing your tone now. I guess.\n",

      "Isn't that true for all players?   I feel like it's easier to clear a player in home facilities, where he can receive treatment all the way until game time then have him travel for hours with the team and try to get him game ready in a hotel on the road.\n",

      "This \"analysis\" is completely meaningless bc it basically disregards the fact that the majority of the games that Embiid missed in the last 5 years were not handpicked single games to rest, but extended stretches with an injury that he had no control over the quality of the opponent.  Specifically,   In 2018-19 he had a stretch of 8 games and a stretch of 3 games missed.   In 2019-20, a stretch of 9 games and a stretch of 5 games missed, plus another 2 games missed due to suspension.   In 2020-21, he had a 14 game stretch where he played in just 2 of them, including missing 10 consecutive games.  In 2021-22, he had a stretch of 9 games missed.   In 2022-23 he had a stretch of 5 games where he only played once, a stretch of 4 games missed and a stretch of 3 games missed.  We can move now to the single game DNPs he received during these years, assuming ofc OP is sane enough to believe that he didnt miss extended periods of time just as a smokescreen to duck a specific hard opponent or out of sheer laziness to travel.  In 2018-19, he sat against Pistons(A), Blazers (A), Hawks (H), Nuggets (A), Hornets (A)  In 2019-20, he sat against Pistons (A), Magic (A), Cavs (H), Nets (A), Pacers (A), Knicks (H), Suns (H)  In 2020-21, he sat against Cavs (A), Nuggets (H), Grizzlies (A), Pistons (A), Pacers (A), Jazz (A), Bucks (A), Pacers (H), Magic (H)  In 2021-22, he sat against Blazers (H), Grizzlies (A), Grizzlies (H), Heat (H), Pistons (H)  In 2022-23 he sat against Kings (A), Heat (A), Nuggets (A)  Thats a total of 18 away games missed compared to 11 home games missed. Out of the 18 away games he missed, 8 were against top-10 teams, ranked by their record at the end of that season. Out of the 11 home games he missed, 3 were against top-10 teams. No1 team avoided ironically were THE PISTONS that he DUCKED 4 times in 5 years. He also ducked nuggets, pacers and grizzlies 3 times each.   To sum it up, Embiid has missed 59 games in extended stretches due to injuries/covid/suspension and 29 games in single game DNPs since 2018-19 season. Out of the 29 single game DNPs, 8 have actually been against top 10 teams away from home. On the basis of these 8 games, OP has made an \"analysis\" that Embiid just habitually decides to sit out against good teams on the road at cost of team success, totally ignoring;  1)the vast majority of games missed are due to extended injuries  2)there are other legitimate reasons for sitting out even on single game DNPs (picking up minor injuries, flare ups or nagging injuries, chronic conditions that require rest in instances of 4 games in 5 days)  3)the narrative of Embiid sitting against good teams to stat pad against bad ones being completely bogus, when its clear from his single game DNPs that he \"decides\" to sit out against a lot of mediocre and bad teams too.

      "Yes, like I said KD is still better and a #1 option. We don't need a #1 option, we need size and shooting that can play off ball. Lauri has the exact same usage rate as Josh Giddey but still puts up super efficient numbers and is a volume 3pt shooter. He also plays bigger than KD. I feel like I shouldn't have to explain what the Thunder need to a Thunder fan?  Also, as long as the trade doesn't include Dub, what price would we not be satisfied with? We have a stupid amount of picks still. Overpaying by a pick or two really doesn't make a difference for us. KD would be expensive too.\n",
      "KD wouldn’t require us to part with Dub/Dort. Lauri DEFINITELY would. Also KD/Lauri average about the same blocks/steals per game, so not sure how Lauri plays bigger? KD playing next to a playmaking PG has always been wildly successful, and SGA would help so much. Do I really need to explain to a Thunder fan what TWO 7-foot tall bigs who can shoot the three ball and play defense mean to a Thunder fan?   Take the hatred sunglasses off. KD would be massive for this team.\n",
      "Offensive rebound %: Lauri _ 70th percentile KD _ 15th percentile  Defensive rb%: Lauri _ 80th percentile KD _ 69th percentile  That is how he plays bigger. Yes KD is a marginally netter defender, but i dont think that is a major concern while playing next to Chet. Its not like Lauri is a turnstyle.   And like I said, I wouldn't give up Dub for either one. It depends on the price. But if we are comparing which one we should give up some sort of haul for, it is Lauri. We need offball size and shooting. Lauri is THE shining example of that in the league.\n",

      ">You know Steph shots per game remained the same with addition of kd  Curry _   '15: 16.8fga  '16: 20.3fga  '17: 18.3fga  '18: 16.9fga  '19: 19.4fga  He immediately dropped ~2 shots a game when KD arrived, an by the next year was taking nearly 4 shots fewer per game than when he won unanimous MVP. It wasn't til their last year that he was back in superstar Steph mode as far as shots went.   That said, Durant *also* initially took fewer shots when he joined GSW; he'd been averaging about 19fga for the five years prior to his move, and then went 16.5, 18 and 17.7 with the warriors.   They both sacrificed a few shots a game to co-exist, Curry took a shot or two more in the first and last years, and Durant took a shot more in their middle one; which, given that they're both extremely efficient but that Curry is generally more efficient, seems like a decent distribution.\n",
      "Meant more so playoff production my mistake. Durant shot 23 shots per game on the thunder his final playoffs there and his first playoffs with gsw shot only 18 fga per game. peaked with 21 on the warriors. Steph shots per game remained pretty much the same besides peaking with about two more shots in his second playoff with kd. They both had an equal amount of sacrifices to make. If anything kd had to change his play style much more than other player on those teams.\n",
      "This is a good perspective _ I suppose other than Westbrook there wasn't someone taking a lot of offensive space up on post-Harden OKC? Whereas in Golden State apart from the most efficient volume scorer you also had Klay (who iirc barely took any fewer shots after Durant joined?) and also players like Iggy _ it was mostly Dray who took a step back on offense right?\n",

The team wasn’t put together to have one on the bench lol. Also just because they game plan for Steph doesn’t mean they’re just gonna let the best iso scorer in the world get what he wants.

If we can't do it that way, we'd have to give up Pritchard, which... I mean Olynyk's better than Pritchard right now, but he's also an impending free agent, whereas Pritchard is locked down on a cheap deal long-term. Is he enough of an upgrade for this season to justify giving up a cost-controlled role player when we're about to be hamstrung by the second apron? I kind of don't think so.

      "That's not entirely true, he suffers mostly from the fact that his most dominant period was when the NBA was at its weakest period and from winning the most when he wasn't the best anymore. Sure, the things you mentioned played a factor, but basketball reasons are why Kareem isn't seem as a GOAT candidate by most.  There were questions whether the NBA was the best basketball league in the World in the 70s and many believed that Dr. J was the best player in the World. Kareem dominated who he faced, but up until the merger, he didn't face the best players. Kareem should only have two MVPs, which is the number he got post-merger, he wouldn't have six if the talent wasn't split.\n",
      "Do you think he would have only 2, or just less than 6?\n",
      "I mean, it's really hard to know right? Common sense would make you believe he'd have more than 2, but less than 6, still that's an impossible question to answer. Dr. J won three straight ABA MVPs from 1974 to 1976, that's two of Kareem's MVPs right there, it's impossible to know who would've won them if they played against each other.  The fact that this is a question to me already is a problem in Kareem's legacy, simply because he didn't face the hardest competion, in fact he had a privilege that no other all-time great in NBA history has ever had. The ABA wasn't some 2nd tier league that nobody cared about, a common sentiment at the time was \"We have Dr. J, do you have anything better?\". When i say that Kareem \"should\" only have two MVPs, i mean more in the sense that we can't possibly know about the other four. Maybe he would've won one more with the merged leagues, maybe two, maybe none, we simply can't know, hence why we can only give him the ones he actually got when there was only one league.  The ABA was so stacked that in the first year after the merger, Dr. J and George McGinnis went to the Sixers and led them to their first Final since Wilt, meanwhile Kareem won four MVPs without ever having to play against any of them.\n",

      "Kareem also was not a fan of being a commodity to be consumed by fans. His life wasn’t for sale and felt that he did not have to “open up or be available” to fans in the way the NBA wanted.    So he wasn’t affable to media and wasn’t endearing to fans. Kareem lack of conversation about his greatness is the easiest way to show bias in every greatest conversation. It’s a popularity contest. Kareem doesn’t have the fans to carry his banner that other even lesser players do. Like there are people today seriously saying Steph is better than Kareem and meeting little resistance. Whereas if you said directly Steph greater than Kobe then there would be a much larger outcry even though they are closer in reality.\n",

      "I think it's more basic than that. Muhammad Ali was even more outspoken and was widely loved for the rest of his life, mostly because he had a fun personality. The NBA as a whole did not have a \"fun\" reputation until the 80's. Magic and Bird made it popular. They had star power in a way that no one before them had. So anyone who was really good at basketball before the 80's just doesn't get the same recognition, because the public mostly didn't care.\n",

      "Peak> longevity. Both are important, but if you had to win it all, who was the best, and who made his team the best? Btw, leadership/influence are underrated in the GOAT convo. MJ was basically a psychopath ahole, but he did make his teammates get better and play better. Yes you have to credit PJ and the coaching staff, but MJ treating every game and practice as a must win pushed players to develop. And like pippen for example, he mentored him, taught him how to play elite defense, he demanded perfection from himself and pretty much everyone else, so either you got better or you got eliminated.  Kobe had a similar attitude but he really didn't have the charisma or natural leadership MJ had, Phil talks about this when he compares them in his book. MJ was charming and well liked by his teammates while they also feared him, Kobe was a little bit more antisocial and reserved personality wise. But certainly you can make the case for him inspiring other players because of his relentless will to win and work ethic. I don't think anyone pushed himself harder than Kobe, which is why he inspired an entire generation, but as far as taking dudes under his wing and teaching them X& Os I think hes done less.  Tim Duncan is very underrated in this aspect, Pop gets all the credit, and pop definitely desrves his flowers  but there has probably never been a more coachable and even keeled all time great than Timmy, and Duncan really built up Spurs culture and helped mentor and develop young dudes.   As far as this post, idk about Kareems or Magics impact in terms of \"coaching\" other players and teaching them. But perhaps this is something that could give them a bump in the all time convo.\n",

      "People rarely talk about 1 year peak in peak vs longevity conversations. It's more like 3-5 year peak vs longevity of career. Regardless, I don't think Steph has Magic beat in either scenario. Magic's 1987 season ended in a championship, MVP, Finals MVP, 1st Team All NBA, and Assist Leader. That's greater than Steph's 2016 season despite the unanimous MVP.  Magic had 9 straight First Team All NBA selections (+ a Second Team), reached the finals 9 times, has 5 championships, 3 MVPs, 3 Finals MVPs, and was a 12x All Star. More accolades in less years than Steph. Steph is gonna have to keep up his production for several more years and get more hardware to catch up.\n",

      "Not sure it did, when he didnt even win finals mvp. Playoffs matter much more than regular season, magic was the clear cut best player in the NBA during his peak, and steph had an amazing amazing regular season, but lebron was probably better in the playoffs, as well as maybe KD.   Thats the thing with lebron MJ (for sure) at their peaks they were clearly better than other HOFs, even early career MJ its really tough to say MJ wasn't better than Bird, Magic, Isaiah etc. But they were on better teams. Prime Dwade and Kobe, Duncan make it harder to say that about young bron, but def at his peak Lebron was better than everyone else, playoffs included.    People do talk about peak and longevity but the best is the best ever, you can be really good for a really long time without ever being the best.  Shaq deserves to be in the GOAT convo, except he had a glaring weakness in not being able to close out games, and he really wasn't half the leader others were.\n",

      "Because the OP’s framing is disingenuous.  He won those 5 MVPs in a weak era when half of the top talent was playing in a separate league. Kareem didn’t even make the playoffs one of the years he won MVP, can you imagine that happening now? Despite this, the only ring he won during this time was when he was paired up with Oscar Robertson. Meanwhile, guys like Dr. J and John Havlicek won multiple rings during this same period without a superstar teammate.  Then he goes to the Lakers where he effectively played on a superteam for a decade straight. Magic was the better player for a majority of their championship runs and Kareem was basically a role player for the last two.  He’s an all time great but I don’t see a GOAT argument for him unless you include and emphasize his high school and college career.\n",
      "Ok for the record Dr J won one NBA rings, he won two ABA rings but that league was even more of a clownshow than the NBA  The ABA snagged a few stars but the rosters were just bereft of NBA talent so of course he won without a superstar  Also he doesn't have a finals MVP\n",

I'm a Celtics fan. I hate defending Lakers. Look.   Mikan was unstoppable under the basket. And he could shoot.

The league average FG% in 1950 was .340, and its NOT because the defense of the day was light years ahead of today NOR is it that ability to shoot was infinitely worse. The game was just played very differently. And Mikan was elite  Compare: back in an era (1950) when League average was .340, Mikan put up .407.      Whereas in the 1990s, when league when average was .464, Jordan's was .501.   Jordan shot .037 over his contemporaries.      Mikan shot .067 over his.

      "What hardware Shaq lost out on, was probably related to his body. He missed at least 20 games in 3 of his 11 prime seasons and missed at least 15 another 3. He also underperformed in several regular seasons due to starting the season out of shape (note that despite his scoring prowess, he only has 1 regular season scoring title, and in 2001, the Lakers won 56 regular season games but had arguably the single most dominant postseason run ever; some more discussion here: https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/search?q=shaq+mvp&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all_).   Hakeem probably missed out on some hardware due to the Rockets being bad around him after 86, but also his 2 years in 94 and 95 were exceptional. He scored substantially more in both the regular season and the playoffs than he usually did, and it doesn't seem like he quite replicated that level of production any other year.\n",

I have him in a tier of 4 players from 13-16 with Jerry West, Oscar Robertson, and Garnett, but I have him as the best of that 4 currently.   I’m a lot lower on both Malones who I have in the 17-22 group with Dr. J, Dirk, Barkley, and David Robinson. Maybe I should be higher on 3 time mvp Moses Malone, but I don’t consider his era as competitive. I guess you could argue Mikan up there if you want to do hypothetical awards for players, but he also played in an era with no shot clock so it’s hard to compare.  At the end of the day, KD has 10 all NBA selections (likely soon to be 11), 4 scoring titles, an MVP, and 2 rings & fmvps. He also has come 2nd in MVP voting three times each time losing to Lebron. Only 36 players have even won an mvp.   Even if you don’t feel his rings should count towards his case, people would clown him so hard if he hadn’t won in those 2 seasons with those teams. He only didn’t get clowned that much in 2019 because he played like 5 minutes in the finals. We clown Lebron for 2011 relentlessly already, and we clown KD for the 3-1 lead in 2016. We shouldn’t reward him for showing up and performing well on the brightest stage twice because he had Steph curry as a teammate, but he should get punished if he hadn’t played well? It’s the same way people try to take away Kobe’s rings with Shaq but also clown him for 2004.\n",

(Though the GSW record without Steph and the GSW record without KD shows that in the *team* game of basketball, Steph is significantly better (because of the factor of his gravity making teammates much better).

      "I mean I’m not sure who outside of the 10 in the title post + Shaq and Hakeem I feel KD is DEFINITELY worse than all time. I have him in a tier of 4 players from 13-16 with Jerry West, Oscar Robertson, and Garnett, but I have him as the best of that 4 currently.   I’m a lot lower on both Malones who I have in the 17-22 group with Dr. J, Dirk, Barkley, and David Robinson. Maybe I should be higher on 3 time mvp Moses Malone, but I don’t consider his era as competitive. I guess you could argue Mikan up there if you want to do hypothetical awards for players, but he also played in an era with no shot clock so it’s hard to compare.  At the end of the day, KD has 10 all NBA selections (likely soon to be 11), 4 scoring titles, an MVP, and 2 rings & fmvps. He also has come 2nd in MVP voting three times each time losing to Lebron. Only 36 players have even won an mvp.   Even if you don’t feel his rings should count towards his case, people would clown him so hard if he hadn’t won in those 2 seasons with those teams. He only didn’t get clowned that much in 2019 because he played like 5 minutes in the finals. We clown Lebron for 2011 relentlessly already, and we clown KD for the 3-1 lead in 2016. We shouldn’t reward him for showing up and performing well on the brightest stage twice because he had Steph curry as a teammate, but he should get punished if he hadn’t played well? It’s the same way people try to take away Kobe’s rings with Shaq but also clown him for 2004.\n",
      ">Even if you don’t feel his rings should count towards his case  I didn't mean that they shouldn't count at all, he was a vital part of that team and should get some credit. But he gets less credit for either of these rings than, let's say, Dirk or Hakeem.    >people would clown him so hard if he hadn’t won in those 2 seasons with those teams  You get clowned when you perform below expectations, and you get praise when you exceed expectations. LeBron gets clowned for 2011, because everyone expected the Heat to win, but they lost, in part because of a subpar performance by LeBron. Nobody is giving him flak for '07 or the three finals against Golden State, because he wasn't favored in these series. In the same vein, KD only gets moderate praise for his rings, because he joined one of the best teams of all time. They were expected to win, and they did. Had they lost, they would've performed massively below expectations and clowned accordingly.\n",

Looks at Men’s Tennis. Federer/Nadal/Djokovic convincingly beat opponents to win Slams for the last 20 years.

      "It was proven that she had sex with multiple men before and after her encounter with Kobe. It was also proven that she attempted to do the same (rape accusations) to other celebrities around that time. Why are you ignoring that?  Blood and semen are only evidence of sexual intercourse, not rape. Vaginal trauma caused by a specific individual is especially difficult to prove if you’re having sex with multiple people during the same time period. You’re guaranteeing he’s guilty without anything to support it.  Kobe was guilty of infidelity, but he likely would not have been found guilty of sexual assualt for many reasons:  The accuser had another man's semen and pubic hair on her panties.  http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/04/us/papers-reveal-new-details-in-kobe-bryant-rape-case.html  https://www.cbsnews.com/news/big-win-for-kobe-defense/  The accuser bragged to at least five friends about having sex with Kobe after the alleged incident, including three days before charges were laid.  The accuser's friend said that she even had a plot to lure Eminem into bed.  https://www.contactmusic.com/kobe-bryant/news/ex.pal-reveals-kobe.s-accuser-plotted-to-lure-eminem-into-bed  The accuser had a history of mental illness and was caught lying and changing her story multiple times. She was also seen leaving the hotel without any visible discomfort.  http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/kobe-accuser-mixups-admits-lies-claim-article-1.548757  Who are you to Kobe or the accuser to think you know what happened in that room? Were you there when it happened? No. Is it possible she lied for personal gain? Yes. Was it proven the accuser attempted to do the same thing to other celebrities during that time period? Yes. Is it possible that he raped her? Absolutely.  Now, I’m going to accuse you of rape and sue you for it. The accusation is going to get around your circle and everyone’s going to believe me, even though you’re certain you didn’t do it. I hope you believe in the concept of innocent until proven guilty.

      "ok? dirk should have won one of nash's mvps, he can be third and still shoulda won.    nash definitely should not have won. i loved nash, first ever basketball jersey. but its not disrespectful to point out that other guys should have won. have a nice day\n",
      "I’m saying even if Nash didn’t win, Shaq and Lebron deserved them more. Not Dirk and definitely not Kobe. Hard to argue Dirk should have won over Nash and Shaq or Nash and Lebron either of those years\n",
      "when the stats advanced or not back it up? dirk was 100% better than nash one of those seasons, live on this fairy tale of Nash being disrespected, but Dirk was the one disrespected (he shoulda finished above 3rd, you using that just backs up my point further). Dirk deserved one, not both. it's not hard at all to argue dirk was better than shaq or lebron those seasons, he literally won an mvp in 07.   as lots were, you included, I was there, watching these games with my own eyes. I'd take dirk in those seasons 100% non bias aside over nash, that doesn't mean nash wasn't a top 10 player or wasn't supremely impactful. it's a joke nash defenders treat it as utter disrespect to say those mvp's shoulda gone to someone else. BTW here's the advanced states   dirk was 4th in BPM, 3rd in VORP, 2nd in win shares per 48, 5th in PER, on a team that won 58 games after losin nash, in the 05 season  dirk was 2nd in BPM, 3rd in VORP, 1st in win shares per 48, 1st in PER in the 06 season on a team that won 60 games.\n",
      "Not even really about Nash, but I really do think Shaq and Lebron had better seasons than Dirk  Also MVP isn’t a best player award or Lebron would have a lot. I would also rather have a few guys over Nash but based on the MVP voting criteria would be a different story\n",
      "in 05*, shaq was a top 10 player but not the MVP, idk why people think he shoulda won it over LeBron/KG/Dirk. he also had DWade who was a top 15 player at that point, at minimum. 05 you could give it to KG/LeBron/maaaaybe Shaq/Dirk  KG team had 44 wins. Dirk carried his team to 58+ wins those seasons, the west was stacked. LeBron played in a weak ass east, no one deserved the mvp from that side when half the games they played were against the shittiest teams possible   06 tho, was Dirks. again, 60 games, no all star second teammate, and the only guy who comes up statistically \"on par\" with dirk that season is LeBron, who played in the weaker conference still. 06 is the one that shoulda been Dirks, shoulda had 06 and 07.\n",

I can think of multiple years (Parker in 2007 for example) where the clear best playoff player overall (Duncan) loses FMVP because of one or two big games from his counterpart.   But overall FMVP is the best approximation of who the best player was on the title team and it’s thus more useful than pure rings.   Otherwise, Horry GOAT?\n",
      "Yes that would be a good award to consider, many players who lose (e.g. LeBron in 2018) could still win the Playoffs MVP, even if KD won the Finals MVP that series.  Also, KC Jones, John Havlicek and Tom Sanders would like a word _ they went 8-0 in the Finals!\n",

Poole and Kuzma take a lot of shots, most of Jones' assists are to them, Jones is the main point guard, with Poole, Kuzma and Avdija holding the ball less, Delon Wright is out, and he doesn't shoot too much (although his 62% shooting seems taken out of a team that is not as awful as Wizards are). Sometimes those three will give the ball to Jones to shoot a three or have a relatively easy one inside, but it's much rarer.\n",

Having a veteran guard like Kyrie who is not \"competing\" with Luka is a whole different dynamic.

Then the Pistons continue their losing streak and lose 17 more in a row and sit at 2-44. That would put the Pistons 27 games back of 10th with 26 games left.   The odds of this happening are insanely improbable and possibly impossible because going on a 17 game win streak would almost certainly gain spots in the standings as this would produce losses to teams that are ahead of the Bulls at the same time.

      "He was given a red card and would have probably been given a 3 day ban for violent conduct. He retired so it's moot. He's now a manager and hasn't been banned from the sport. Indeed, he's revered. The point is that he's not in jail.   There have been plenty of dirty players in most sports. Roy Keane famously broke haalands leg https://youtu.be/p_st29mlQwU?si=kHxA6OsfXS7bWn_X  He was not sent to prison. He got a red card, served a 3 match ban and was back on the pitch.  Joe Dumars punched plenty of people. He's now in a position of power in the NBA.   I'm not defending draymond. I'm saying hard fouls happen, you can't send people to jail for them.\n",
      "So what you’re saying is he was immediately removed from the game and never played a soccer game again?   Interesting. I wonder why that doesn’t apply for Draymond.  Is punching Jordan Poole during practice when he’s not playing a “hard foul” or is it battery?\n",

      "Stop being this delusional.   Nobody is “mad” we just want some accountability. Dray gets a soft whistle while badmouthing refs and doing questionable shit on court.   Start with some actual consequences for his actions don’t slap his wrist with zoom calls and making him out to be a victim.   Minimum suspensions easily, not just “when he is ready” to start. Escalate it further as he keeps his antics up, it’s not that hard.\n",
      "I mean you’re asking for a bunch of things they’re already clearly doing.  They have been giving him escalating consequences, just like you asked. They’ve even explicitly stated that his history is a reason for the length.  They’ve also given him more than a “slap on the wrist”, just like you asked. An 11 game suspension would be the longest suspension for on court dirty play since 2006, 17 years.   So yeah. People are just not paying attention and asking for things that are already happening. Which leads me back to the original question lol\n",

Hitting someone in the face with your elbow when they aren't looking, choking someone, and stomping on someone's lungs are MUCH closer to killing someone than merely holding a gun (with safety on?) and pointing it at a phone.

The fact you're comparing literally zero violence to actual assault is just complete ridiculousness and maximum copium.\n",

Ja has a right to defend himself.   But you like to just ignore all nuance and argue “he’s a minor so it’s worse”. Not to mention, Draymond is in his 30s and has had literally dozens of chances to change. COPIUM\n",

I would give them more of a pass if they really did seem to take things seriously but their history of light suspensions and  the whole Morant debacle last year shows they dont. The guy basically  threatened to kill somebody on Twitter and NBA doesn't even address it. They wait and wait and wait until the public backlash gets too bad to ignore them they suspend him as little as possible so as to not hurt ticket sales.

      "I mean the really bad thing he did was beat up the wrong guy.  That fan hit him with a drink when he was lying down on the scorer's table trying to calm down.  While his actions were deplorable, at least I can understand the motivation and how he reached that boiling point given the prior blowup/fight with the Pistons players.  But it is what it is.  Being a fan of a dirty player doesn't make you a bad person, or make your championships worth less.  But that doesn't mean you have to back their actions come hell or high water.  Pistons fans love Laimbeer, but you'd be hard-pressed to find a pistons fan who will say Laimbeer was a wholesome guy who wasn't dirty.\n",

Draymond literally ran off multiple teammates, among a litany of other offenses to his team such as fighting with Warriors staff, the referees, the league, media figures, and more.

Case in point: after the OKC 3-1 comeback for the Warriors, Lebron stepped over Draymond (of which, Draymond was intentionally trying to get in the way of Lebron so he couldn’t move on). Warriors fans loved moaning so hard over that. How unfair it was. How the league hated them. How there’s some sort of gambling ring that manipulated that. That “if this was the 90’s someone would get shot”.  So much copium. So much insecurity and lack of personal awareness.   But wake up! Warriors fans were literally a few games before SCREAMING that Draymond was just in a natural shooting motion; the worst.\n",

      "Idk man _ I would at least put meta and draymond on the same level. If meta had put someone in a choke hold two weeks prior to that bow to hardens face, and gotten suspended the prior playoffs for recklessly stomping on a players chest, I think his suspension would have been a lot longer.   It does seem like he’s been treated with kid gloves in terms of how long it’s taken to get this suspension.  IMO the stomping was worse than metas elbow and should have gotten the equivalent of metas suspension. Following that up with a choke hold should’ve doubled the suspension.\n",

The suspension they gave Draymond for the Gobert incident was the harshest they’ve given for an on the court action in like a decade.

And I do agree Green being gone is such a relieve, the Wolves beat the Warriors twice earlier this season but every minute had me worrying Green would give our players a season ending injury.  Also, is there correlation between rappers flashing guns and the (comparatively) high amount of rappers dying to gunshots?

      "Fucking Americans being so nonchalant about guns never cease to amaze me. Draymond is a piece of shit but a punch is NOT even close to brandishing a gun on ig live. In other countries just holding a gun is a crime outside of special cases, while a punch would at most get you disciplinary actions. You may say \"but this is America yadda yadda\" but your smooth brain wouldn't even comprehend that people like Morant is the reason your kids could be dead in a ditch in the evening when you just took them to school 10 hours prior.\n",
      "Yeah I grew up in the 90s where essentially every rapper flashed guns constantly.  I don’t understand it but it is culture here and it honestly seems racist to give double the suspension for that and someone consistently assaulting opposing players half the amount of time.\n",
      "I mean fair, but it's hardly racist when they're both african-american. And I do agree Green being gone is such a relieve, the Wolves beat the Warriors twice earlier this season but every minute had me worrying Green would give our players a season ending injury.  Also, is there correlation between rappers flashing guns and the (comparatively) high amount of rappers dying to gunshots? Maybe it's just me but when a rapper's death hit the news, it's 70% chance that they died in a gun-relation altercation\n",
      "I am sure there is but it persists.  If it was ostracized as a society, fine. And it should be bc that is most gun-related deaths.  But it feels like to me like the white Adam Silver and NBA owners don’t like, Ja’s culture and so they are making an extreme example out of him.  They both probably should have been around 15 games.\n",
      "I get the point but I still think that racism or not, this need to be addressed. Guns have no business being this common and easy to obtain. Better be extreme now rather than regret it later if Ja shot someone.\n",

      "Because the layers of Draymond’s childish, insecure, and violent behavior are plentiful.  Metta World Peace/Ron Artest definitely had a bad history but come on: Draymond literally shlumped his teammate and got protected from it. Besides the violence, he loves getting drunk at the parade and then without any wit, will shit on the team that lost in just a weird unsportsmanlike way.  Draymond is the worst kind of dude, the guy who literally deflects all blame and gets away with it. And tons of people out there are like “he’s just passionate”. No decency.  1000% Draymond is going to join Inside the NBA (my worst nightmare) and then never listen to any opinion besides his own, all while saying he can because he “won rings”. Yuck.\n",
      "I think you are misremembering or underestimating all of the things Ron Artest did in his career if you think Draymond is on another level in terms of shenanigans.\n",
      "I think you’re engaging in whataboutism- I wholeheartedly supported Ron Artest getting punished because that’s how it’s supposed to go. Draymond Green deserves punishment for all the horrible stuff he’s done; for the things he’s also done to the people he’s supposed to be captaining.  These events of Draymond being violent and petty are not occurring in a vacuum; the pattern is screaming to be recognized because Draymond never possessed the humility to hold back.  He’s the kind of guy who thinks he’s the strongest because he acts on his emotional impulse, when the real bigger men are actually restrained.  I also 1000% believe that Draymond and his fans are gonna say something like “oh the haters always doubt Draymond” as if we were shaming Draymond for his play. No, this isn’t about contributions on defensive sets etc. It’s about his narcissism and how he’s hurt people thanks to his attitude and idiocy, etc.  I don’t understand why Warriors fans don’t just look up to Curry, the real generational talent for the Warriors and overall a more buttoned up and respectable player. First Warriors fans had to cry over Monta, and now they wanna moan with Draymond vs. Curry.\n",

      "Indefinite doesn’t mean a shitload of time/games as it’s often construed as. It just means there’s no set term. However quick it takes Draymond to finish the terms set for reinstatement is the length of the suspension. If he does it quickly it’s X games, if he stalls therapy it’s more time. This is not say they didn’t give him a slap on the wrist, just to say “indefinite” is misconstrued.\n",

      "Interesting. How about when he punched Jordan Poole in the face?\n",
      "Honestly, that should have been prosecuted. That is actual assault.\n",
      "I just don’t understand how you watch a video of him punching Nurkic in the face and don’t think that’s assault. I guess with your flair you can blur your eyes though to pretend like it was an accident.\n",
      "I don’t think it was an accident, I think it was a flagrant foul penalty 2.\n",
      "I mean, this response is an obviously dense one. Sure, thats what the refs called because that’s the maximum foul call on a basketball court, but for you to sit there, admit it wasn’t an accident and then say it’s different than any other person punching someone in the face is either 100% rose tinted bias glasses or you’re trolling.\n",
      "Look, if we can stop the ridiculous escalation of arguments for a bit I can give a real honest answer.  You can see Draymond flail backwards, trying to act like Nurkic was fouling him, and trying to pretend the contact is what caused him to swing his arm around.  However, he wasn’t looking at Nurkic when he did it, which is why I wouldn’t call it a punch. In addition, if you watch the play a few times, it looks like he kinda tries to pull back at the last second when he realizes he is going to hit him in the face, which is why he ends up kinda hitting him with his wrist and forearm.  He wildly and recklessly swung his arm backwards when he knew a player was there, which is why I think suspension is justified. But it is not the same as a punch, where you look at what you are swinging at and try to his someone in the face with your fist. He was trying to hit Nurkic with his arm, but I don’t think it was a punch.\n",

They might not be good with him, but they definitely are not good without him. The current suspension is over 10% of the regular season, which is enough to matter. Don't ask me how I know...\n",

      "I don’t think anyone is saying it’s not a long suspension but most people (including me) do not think it’s a long enough suspension. The punishment does not seem consistent to other cases. An easy case to compare is Ja. He had a warning suspension of 8 games (if I remember correctly) and he clearly didn’t learn from it which gave a longer suspension after that. Prior to this he has not had many issues on the court. Draymond has been a menace on the court for a long time while hiding behind the guise of being an “enforcer”. Taking his past actions into account I believe his suspension should be much longer. He is physically hurting other players without seeming remorseful or apologetic about it. He keeps playing the victim card while getting a light slap on the wrist.\n",
      "He isn’t getting suspended compared to Ja because everything Draymond has done has been on court related   Ja’s actions are a danger to himself and others, and especially to the nba from a legal standpoint. It’s not even comparable\n",

      "I'm asking this legitimately no troll shit but if he comes back after 13 games what exactly is everyone in here gonna do besides complain. No one's gonna stop watching. Adam Silver and the NBA won't change at all. Draymonds a fucking dickhead but we've got plenty of players who have done some crazy shit who are still in the NBA. I'm not sure what everyone's goal is here. Most of you think he's gonna re offend anyway no matter how long he's suspended.\n",
      "Name a player who has broken that invisible code on the court more than him?  Dude has a worse reputation than anyone in nba history for cheap shots.  Literally historically bad\n",
      "God you must be a child if you think draymond is the worst offender. Meta world peace, Isiah Thomas, bill lambier and Dennis Rodman just to name few have done some shit way worse shit.\n",
      "Not only did I watch all of those guys live, I can tell you from historical fact, that you're misremembering things.  You picked four guys that you can think of with a 'dirty' reputation. I'm telling you that even with Laimbeer's horrible reputaiton, he's still not had as many ejections as Green.  In fact the only guy with more ejections in a game in Rasheed who has 9 more, but the majority of his are from double techs, not flagrant 2s.  Green has hit guys in the nuts 3?4? times? Literally lost the Warriors a title by doing it to Lebron. I can't remember at this point what he's at. Smashed Sabonis in the ribs with a stomp, Flying back fisted Nurkic, Rear naked choked Gobert, and you don't need me to tell you how he treated his own teammates.  You can point to individual plays, the closest you can get to is Laimbeer who had less ejections than Reggie Miller. In fact, Bill isn't even top 10.  Copium is hard, but Draymond is by far the worst offender in NBA history. Not just one cheap shot, not just one flagrant ejection... the most in history. If he keeps on getting tossed for arguing with the refs he'll pass Rasheed as well.\n",
      "LMAO BULLSHIT.   You watched these players live? but don’t mention meta world peace punching people in the stands or elbow spinning James harden in the head.   Or you know laimbeer being known as the dirtiest player of all time? Flagrants wasn’t introduced until 1991 so you using stats like getting kicked out of games is pointless.   Stop the bullshit my man. You didn’t watch shit if you actually think this.\n",

      "Jesus christ. In trying to determine whether this was too small a suspension, I had to stop and think about **which** incident this was for and then try to think about if there were any other incidents this season. Then I decided it was too likely I'd miss something or forget one so I just googled it.\n",

      "My thoughts, Brunson is that dude. Best player on the floor today, and that’s not cuz Giannis and Dame were playing bad, he was just the better player today.  I still think Randle is not in his final form. He’s one of the only PFs in the league who can really bang with Giannis. I still think Randle hasn’t fully tapped into his physicality.  Obviously we all know Dame and how good of a player he is, but he just adds such an X factor to the Bucks. He can totally shift momentum with some deep 3s.  Gg\n",

      "I presume Pop made him a PG to develop his playmaking.  Sochan has many tools to be an excellent basketball player, but he's not a great passer or a good shooter. Let him run the offense now, eventually he'd play as a forward with playmaking abilities.   See what you got there before you just relegate him to be an energy guy. It's a lost season anyways, try to develop your young players.  There was one season where the Spurs would disrupt their usual flowing offense so Kawhi could take these awkward post-ups.

Certainly fits their timeline better than a 27yo Zach Collins, too.  But Pops loves his white Cs (Pau, Poetl, Drew Eubanks, Jock Landale, Oberto, Bertans,  Matt Bonner, Rasho, Boban, Tiago Splitter, Aron Baynes, Cherokee Parks, Sean Marks, Danny Ferry, etc), ever since he traded Rodman for Will Perdue.

He had one of the more unconventional journeys to get to the NBA at 19. Now at age 20, he’s basically having to learn his game again, to play a role he never has, with a microscope and a half on him because he’s going through this in Wemby’s debut season.  And fuck if not for nothing, the kid is still doing it all with a smile. If the pg role doesn’t workout, I still want him on the team for the length of his career.

Pops decided the best way to accelerate that process is to put the ball in his hand a huge amount of the time in hopes that his Bball IQ and playmaking can improve.    To me this always felt like a development play. If Sochan can be a facilitating forward that is great. He will never be a PG but in a year where you’re likely a year away and don’t have a true starting point guard may as well. Sochan also appears to be bought in on whatever development strategy the team throws at him. If this experience can help him be a reasonable passer long term then it’s worth it.\n",

      "As an okc fan, you should know it takes more than 1 guy to win. That's why Okc is doing so great this year compared to the last few. Wemby is also playing a large amount of minutes with Tre. It will probably actually be better for him in the long term to get time playing with both a real PG in Tre & playing without 1 (his minutes with sochan) and being forced to create more offense on his own.\n",
      "OKC tanked by playing G leaguers and resting Shai with injuries. They never looked like an AAU team on the court nor did they ice out their best players  And really we only have one other top pick in Chet. Giddey is a bust and Jalen Williams and Cason Wallace were lower lotto guys\n",
      "Okc is probably the deepest team in the nba this year. The Giddey bust talks are premature. The concerns about fit have always been there, but overall, as a player, he was looking great last season. This year, he is obviously struggling mentally as a result of all the off-court stuff.  Outside of the guys you mentioned, they turned Lu dort from an undrafted guy into one of the leagues top lockdown defenders & he now has a decent offensive game. Okc also picked up Isaiah Joe as a free agent after Philly dropped him at the bottom of the barrel & now he's not only one of the leagues best shooter's, he's becoming an all around player. Aaron Wiggins & Jaylin williams were both 2nd round draft pick and have been huge for them. Jalen williams was a lower lotto guy, but nobody, aside from maybe the guys who scouted him could have thought he would be this good this quickly. Tre Mann has also been looking great, but OKC is so deep now that he's having trouble even getting off the bench.\n",

      "Wemby struggles to establish position in the paint. This isn't 1995 where help defense is illegal and you can just tee up an entry pass. Defenders will hedge against Wemby in the post and force him to catch the pass further away from the basket.  That's not on the point guard.\n",

Clip 2 _ good post positioning by wemby but the Spurs player had a ton of space and made the floater. So nothing wrong with this play or its outcome. An open shot is always better than passing.  3. Wemby never establishes a good post position here. There's defenders in between him and the ball so not sure what you're seeing. When he does get good post position he immediately moves forward for the pass and checks up at the top of the wing. Which is a perfect example of my original point that Wemby struggles to establish post position and running post up plays.   Do  you actually understand the sport of basketball? Don't post clips if you don't know what you're watching.\n",

      "No one thinks Sochan is the worst player in the league.  The Pistons exist.  But, he is an objectively terrible NBA player. A 9.6 PER. 15 means average. 30 means MVP and HOF worthy. So, each PER point really matters and indicates impact. He's really, really far away from even being remotely average.   Pop does have some blame though. If he still holds a front office position, then a lot of blame. It takes pure malpractice or just fucking being dumber than a box of rocks to be as bad as San Antonio is this year. Since Pop seems like a really smart guy in general, then it just has to come down to malpractice.\n",

      "Eh, idk about that. Like, do they both flop and embellish to get free throws? Absolutely. But only one is throwing himself sideways onto the ground while flipping the ball underhand at the basket around the three point line any time someone besides on them\n",
      "[Heres Jimmy throwing himself into a help defender at the 3 point line to draw a foul](https://youtu.be/MuNfZeHYjgo?si=NKC5T7QPvGYPr2SX)   [Another flop at the 3 point line](https://youtu.be/IlCNsnXcVFk?si=2FsgW2U5nwLOYq3O)  [Another one but this time throwing the ball](https://youtube.com/shorts/kGVCl17GoWI?si=t4YtKTL1rX5SyJFK)  And that was just a quick 10 second search. I think they’re both just as bad or close enough that if one is \"unwatchable garbage\", then they both are.\n",
      "The second one is closest and definitely bad, the first he neither throws the ball nor throws himself away(or into) his defender. and I distinctly remember the third one(largely because the announcers were saying the same thing about it being a flop until an angle from the front was shown), that angle is horrendous and doesn't show that horford got him across both forearms, which is what made the ball go the way it did lol. [none of those are on the same level as this](https://youtu.be/R0Jx7dD4CBU?si=4wK3r7qUOseJzfXX), [or this](https://youtube.com/shorts/MoADWyI0RL4?si=EgntDsK2DL_n_FFA), [or this](https://youtu.be/V8-epvUAbX8?si=Q8eIGv5phYyEVXs-). And I expect some level of foul baiting and flopping, pretty much every top tier player does it. But I've never watched a game with embiid that *hasn't* featured him absolutely obliterating the other teams center with his size, and then later throwing himself like he got hit by a freight train when a 6'3, 190 lb guy breathes close to him, hitting the floor, then sitting there looking incredulous that someone just tried to apparently murder him.\n",
      "The first one he looks right at the help defender and throws himself backwards and laterally into him to draw a foul. There’s a reason the refs called it a rip through and not a shooting foul.   I only picked those because you mentioned the 3 point line. I can show you ones that are just as bad as the one you linked inside the 3 point line.   [Like this one](https://youtube.com/shorts/kA_cX59UAY4?si=FqUjQfT_O3ZTsKVi)  [Or this one](https://youtu.be/eBB40YqgARw?si=GoMsQmi8CxEybDir)  [Again, this is like 30 seconds of searching](https://youtube.com/shorts/V1jCik7a-ng?si=I3WAwYxgSKe5lxuD)  [One more for good luck](https://youtube.com/shorts/s_PspRwyfVk?si=GknF4wKRMWBPw5Um)  Once again, Jimmy is just as bad or close enough that if you’re gonna call Embiid unwatchable than Jimmy is as well.\n",
      "And once again, these are not every game things. I've yet to see embiid not do it in a game, multiple times a game typically. And it's funny that you don't even bother to try to refute that. Jimmy does it occasionally, already admitted that, but it isn't every game he throws himself to the ground in ridiculous fashion cause someone half his size touched him. Also as I said, I expect it to happen occasionally, every top tier guy does it... But there's a reason embiid is constantly called out on it, and Jimmy pretty much only is in defense of someone else flopping lol. They are not anywhere near the same level, and trying to make that claim is just hilarious. I'm gonna stop here, cause neither of us is gonna change the others mind, and it ain't worth either of us ending up worked up or wasting a bunch of time on. Have a good one man, good luck today, I hope it's a good game.\n",
      "So you’ve watched every single game Embiid has played? You know for a fact Embiid does this every game. The fact I was able to very quickly give you 7 examples of Jimmy and they’re all in a Heat uniform should tell you the frequency. It’s not just \"occasionally\". Embiid does the exact same thing but you’re grossly overestimating embiids frequency and underestimating jimmy’s frequency.   > But there's a reason embiid is constantly called out on it, and Jimmy pretty much only is in defense of someone else flopping lol.  Yeah it’s because this sub hates Embiid and loves Jimmy.\n",
      "Jimmy has played 318 games in a heat uniform. 7 examples is quite literally a drop in the bucket frequency wise bud. I never said I watched every game embiid has played, not every game I've watched him play he does it, you really trying to say that he *only* does it when I watch him, and no other time? Lmfao. And \"because this sub hates embiid and loves Jimmy\" doesn't account for everything outside of this sub that is the same way lmfao. Also, hilarious to say this sub loves Jimmy 😂😂😂. Go enjoy your team play today man, you're getting way too worked up over this\n",
      "You do realize that it was 7 samples in like 2 minutes right? You do recognize the difference? It’s not that those are the only 7 samples I could find. It’s that I was able to find such a large amount in almost no time which means there are plenty more out there.   > Also, hilarious to say this sub loves Jimmy 😂😂😂.   Jimmy is one of the most loved players on this sub what are you talking about   > Go enjoy your team play today man, you're getting way too worked up over this  If you’re going to also engage in a conversation, don’t try to act superior to the other person.

      "I actually can't wait for him to get back on court, start barking at the officials, committing technicals and flagrants, and just being the all-round menace we love to hate. And leave the NBA with egg on their face.  The NBA Ringer podcast had a good bit about this recently. It's not that recent punishments have been too harsh or too lenient, it's that the process of accountability is all twisted up and all a bit ad hoc because the league is trying to avoid any transparency. And how the league should've really steered clear of any sort of arrangement in which they become tied up with a player's mental health. They should just focus on behaviour and the leave the underlying mental diagnosis to the player's and team's own specialists. Just creating a weird sort of precedent that definitely will result in more confusion down the line if something similar happens again.  Adam Silver has been mostly good as a commissioner so far, but he's pretty turnover prone when it comes to player punishments.\n",
      "100% agree with this. NBA needs to stop prescribing treatments like they’ve done here and with Ja and Irving, and stick with clear suspensions. They’re not changing these dudes. Doubt any of them take it seriously. And like you said it adds a weird vagueness to the punishment. Just give ‘em the suspensions based on severity and increase the # of games with every future incident.\n",

      "He really need to be punished far more severely. suspended from games indefinitey isn’t far enough. He shouldn’t be allowed back with the team. It should be solitary confinement in a jail or something. And also they need to just say he banned from the nba for life and then the government should step in and make sure he’s not allowed within 100ft of a court for the rest of his life. Also they should forcibly seize all his assets. Just some zoom calls and suspension is so weak.  Steve Kerr should be imprisoned as well for enabling\n",

      "You think you're giving an enlightened take here, but this is very regressive. When you have anger issues and violence issues and they lead to problems and drama in your career, your reputation, your social life. That's literally how we define poor mental health. \"Some people are just bad\" is a very toxic thing to throw out there. Therapy is absolutely what is needed here.   The real argument you should be making is \"Can significant progress be made here in a short amount of time?\". Which I would agree with. That said, this is the biggest public shaming moment and \"fuck around and find out\" moment of his life, which could lead to serious motivation for self reflection. Anything is possible.   I say all this as his biggest and longest-running hater.\n",
      "I think what your comment speaks to is the media, and our culture’s, black-and-white thinking with regards to the relationship of “needing help” and “taking accountability.” Draymond both needs to be held appropriately accountable for his actions AND be seen as someone who needs to get help and can, in fact, change his behavior. It’s baked right into our penal code that punishment is just supposed to idk, make you suffer and then…. Nothing else.\n",
      "I think you're right in general, but I'm not sure to what extent that applies to Draymond. If this is something that's present in more areas of his life than just basketball then absolutely, I agree that he needs help. If this is something he's only doing on court then I don't think that language is *necessarily* accurate.  Is he genuinely lashing out with uncontrollable anger because of a high-stress competitive environment or is he just being a cunt, fully aware of what he's doing? If it's the former then I still agree with you, but if it's the latter then the only thing that's going to make him stop is to actually get punished for it rather than coddled by a joke of a suspension and some zoom calls.\n",

      "I think Draymond clearly has anger issues and outbursts, which you can argue falls somewhere on the mental health issue spectrum. It doesn't mean he has something that might require extensive treatment, but mental health struggles can be acute. That being said, that doesn't mean he shouldn't be held accountable for his actions.   As someone with clinically diagnosed OCD, besides my compulsions ruining my own life they would impact those who I love and care about. Part of my recovery was recognizing that and helping use that to get better, and being held accountable in those places, but working on ways to actually deal with my mental illness.   What I worry with Draymond and this portrayal is the \"he's ill therefore he should be absolved of outbursts\" attitude. That's dangerous, and unhealthy. I don't think Draymond is a sociopath who would hurt anyone to get what he wants, I do think he has a short temper and never properly has learned how to deal with his anger and frustration. I definitely think counseling and treatment programs focused on anger management and dealing with stress can do him value if he takes it seriously. However, just because someone is mentally ill, shouldn't excuse them of their repeated bad behavior.\n",

      "Personally, I don’t think Draymond actually recognizes he has a problem and a big part of it is the warriors organization. The organization has been spewing out so much  “take the good with the bad” or “he is the heart of the team” type rhetoric for years to the point he feels he is in untouchable. Just listening to his podcast, the number of times he says “that’s just who I am” and “ I stand on that” type bullshit is enough to tell me he has no intention to change. They even made a dumbass wellness/meditation documentary for him on Amazon prime and still his behavior is the same. I’m a warriors fan and at this point it is embarrassing. I feel the only way to change shit is a long indefinite suspension like on the order of months. He needs to be afraid that he will lose all the shit he has worked hard for in order to change. He needs that fear of God in him.\n",

      "Draymond Green has a tremendous success learning therapy and learning his lessons about punch dick control, stomping, choking and others. We are integrating better techniques such as advanced breathing controls.   We have stimulated his anger by showing him pictures of Poole, Rudy and various others one (Sabonis chest, Adams groin and nuts ) and he didn't pull any triggers.  Experiments are working, he is expecting to be reintegrated into Warriors lineup soon.\n",

      "I’m really confused as to why people think that draymond is just a violent person and that this is not coming out of any sort of issues that he is struggling with. Have you never seen him talk? He is obviously dealing with so many insecurities leading to him having such a big ego and he obviously has a very distorted perception off himself and his actions which definitely needs to be challenged, so having these talks about his mental health seem very important. I just hope that they take time and don’t rush because a 2 week anger management isn’t gonna help anyone.  Edit: It makes me really pessimistic that people think that people are just born being assholes without even questioning the source of that asshole behavior.\n",
      "I imagine the hope is that this spurs him into continuing anger management courses for as long as he needs. The league could have just suspended him for 15 games and then had him come back and play like nothing happened. Instead, they're pushing him to actually make a change that may better his life (and value to the league) while suspending him. It seems like most people here would've been happier if they just suspended him and left it at that. The Zoom meetings and check-ins are of course happening to make sure everyone's doing what they said they would and not just paying off a therapist to sign off on shit.\n",

      "My point is that assholes of course need to take responsibility for their action but that starts also with understanding what the reason behind their action is. Both can coexist. And addressing the issues behind an action is also a way of making people take on the responsibility for it. Like I said I hope it’s not just a short term anger management thing for draymond which it seems like it is but I still think there is some worth in trying to find a setting which helps him find solutions to these issues and not just banning him for a year and hoping that he learns something out of that negative consequence.\n",
      "I don't think competition is good for him. It reminds me of Metta World Peace learning in therapy that hitting a gamewinner was as dangerous for him as getting in a fight. Anything that took him out of his baseline was too emotionally volatile and brought out his worst behavior. I just don't think draymond can handle the emotional swings of competition right now.  Thank you for being one of the few empathetic people in this entire thread btw.\n",

      "I think one of the problems in this discourse is that when people say \"he needs help\", other people read it as \"he's a victim\" or \"he's mentally ill\". I dont think anyone truly believes he's a victim. I certainly dont. That said, I think it's obvious he's *literally incapable* of controlling himself, so in that way, he does *need help* figuring out how the heck to do so. I also dont think he'd be defined as \"mentally ill\", but he's very obviously a dysfunctional person, maybe as bad as Artest maybe, or really, anyone with massive impulse control issues. I personally am a big believer in the power of therapy as opposed to punishment. I think it's unrealistic to imagine that longer and longer suspensions will make a difference. If jail time doesn't make criminals better, I doubt forcing a man to live in his beautiful mansion with a loving family and expensive wine will. I think it is interesting to see a sports league experiment with creative new ways to handle player discipline. I hope it works. But hey, maybe the solution is \"he's unsalvageable, kick him to the curb\", which i fully admit may be the only feasible option if this doesnt work.\n",

      "In the first year that Curry won MVP, a lot of people were arguing for Harden instead, and I still regularly see people argue that Harden should have won that MVP. However, when I sliced the stats by whether or not the opponent made the playoffs, Harden had good stats against playoff teams and amazing stats against non-playoff teams, while Curry was the exact opposite (largely because he tended to sit out fourth quarters against bad teams because the games were already out of reach). All of that's a long way of saying that I think people should pay more attention to splits versus good / bad opponents, but I don't think a lot of people do.\n",

      "Yet he still gets shit on. So many People here don’t watch or understand ball and just want to repeat Reddit comments about who’s a winner n who ain’t . Embid struggles in the playoffs are due to health : injury + conditioning . But also because he was relatively a weak passer vs arguably being the leagues most dominant scorer .  Teams would double/triple him to minimise his scouting opportunities. It’s why it’s weird to me to just look at his ppg drop with how he was constantly doubled/tripled vs nets n raptors . Or how in g6/7 Celtics decided to let harden beat them and play the embid harden pnr purely for the pass to embid and this shut down both as harden scoring n rim pressure ain’t there consistently anymore. Same shit happens to AD with the doubles n triples.  But embid is a better jump shooter and less of a roll man etf which has its own challenges.   This year I’ll be very interested to see playoffs assuming he’s heskthy : embid has grown as a passer and their ifffence runs through him : he leverages his scoring passing and nurse has plenty of movement ( and maxey being a stud ) means it’s harder to shut down embid .   Despite this fir all the shit embid gets and while I think he needs to prove himself in the playoffs more ; he’s still been hugely impactful by any metric in the playoffs. Untill he was injured n slowed down in g6-7 vs celtivs he was having a monster defensive impact playoff run : and he has always had absurd on/off splits playoff or regular season despite the injuries. This isn’t a case of him being one dimensional scorer who can’t make huge impact when he scores less. I believe his impact metrics were overall nearly identical last year playoffs to Tatum/butler even with injury: his defence being a huge + for the team . I get it his flopping is annoying at his size but he’s so god Damn skilled I can’t get that mad tbh cos his scoring package is like an all time wings in a huge centres body. maybe I’m a fraud basketball fan but ti me I’d rather watch embid play style over Giannis : both get equal amount of fts but the offensive  fouls n lack of touch out weigh the flopping. Flopping is mostly on the refs n lesgue to let defenders play ; same shit euth offensuve fouls Giannis does\n",

In general, Embiid punishes bad defense by scoring himself (either through drawing fouls from worse defenders or just overwhelming them physically and with scoring skill), while Jokic will carve up a bad defense with his passing. What strikes me about Jokic's stat is that it shows that good teams are much better at taking away his teammates' easy baskets than bad teams. Jokic is obviously also so skilled that he can successfully make up for that with his own scoring, but against bad teams he doesn't need to, and he can gift dunks and 3s to all the people who don't get open against the good teams.\n",

      "I need everyone to stop and read the definition of how usage% is calculated. Hint: it's not a direct measure of effort, involvement in the offense, or minutes.  Usage% really should be called something like \"finish%\" because that's really what it measures, how often a player finishes plays when he's on the court _ either with a shot attempt, by being fouled, or by turning the ball over.  Better defenses are better at rotating and eliminating advantages, and they're better at eating clock... which means that Jokic has to take more of the shots himself, either throwing up grenades, cleaning up on the boards, or making tough shots because cuts and spot up shooters are denied. This isn't really suggesting that he's 'coasting' less as such, it's more reflecting that offensive possessions are playing out differently.\n",
      "Exactly. Technically speaking a higher USG% could actually mean that he has higher turnovers that are usually assists vs top teams compared to bottom 10. If you average 25/10/10 with 1 turnover it's a lower USG% than 25/10/7 with 4 turnovers (if FGA/FTA remain the same).\n",

      "This is funny but it reflects mostly how offenses respond differently to Embiid vs Jokic. Good defenses mostly try to force Jokic to be a scorer (his usage goes up), while good defenses tend to try and deny Embiid's scoring and make someone else beat them (his usage goes down).  Bad teams tend to be bad at protecting the paint, which means that a lot of possessions are ending with Joel just casually waltzing in there and scoring easily. Whereas against those same teams the Nuggets' offense is spreading the opportunities to finish more evenly anyway.\n",

If everyone is cooking Jokic never hijacks the offense to get shots up.   It's not a great quality for regular season win totals, as often Denver plays down to their competition, and Jokic can be pretty passive against teams Denver should kill.\n",

      "That's undeniable however they are very different players. Jokic has entire quarters where he doesn't shoot against lottery teams. The other night he took 1 shot in the 2nd quarter which was a layup. He was getting single coverage with someone digging in. Was not inserted in scoring.\n",

      "C'mon. Jokić is the best passing big man of all time. Good teams take away his passing lanes to restrict the Nuggets' ball movement and force him to do more on his own. Hence his higher usage rate.  Embiid is a dominant 1-on-1 scorer without Jokić's elite passing skills. Good teams will double & triple him to stop him from getting the ball at all or getting into the lane. Hence his usage rate will go down.  This stat is very understandable if you consider their playstyles.\n",

Also, can I see a source for that stat? I don’t think Embiid is trying to dodge Jokic or Giannis or the best team’s. I do think some of the noise (over the past 5 years) is that more of Embiid’s overall games could be against teams .600 or over as his division is typically better than the Nugget’s or Bucks and more of his games could be against 48+ win teams. Raptors, Nets, Celtics, and Knicks have all been playoff caliber teams (typically) in recent memory whereas eastern central has been pretty bad outside of the bucks.\n",

      "Id agree, but in almost every game he has a similsr number of assists and whatnot. Maybe coasting is the wrong word. He feels more passive in those games.  Like there is a lower chance of him getting a lot of rebounds, points or assists against bad teams.\n",

      "Not really. If you check the stats youd see that his assist mumbers are almost always consistent no matter how much he actually scores.   They more so reflect how well the rest of the team is shooting.  Like it isnt so much about how good they are, but that they arent lossing.  I dunno how much you follow Nuggets games, but its rare for Jokic to even get to double digit points unless nobody else can get a shot up.  However this also often depends on whether Jamal is playing, since hed often split the fascilitating role with Jok.  In fact for the most part his best games are often lossing ones as the rest of the team is probably strugling to get shots in and whatnot and hed usually do a lot in the 2nd half to try and get the team to a win.  But when they dont need to worry about lossing, he lets the other guys take the lead.  As fkr the supporting cast, it often depends. Like sometimes they will be hot and other times its gonna be very bad.  Like MPJ can either score between 20 and 30 or just under 10. Jamals usually gonna get you about 20. Gordons gonna get around 14ish. And KCP isnt gonna get you much, maybe a couple of 3s (but his defensive contribution is insane tbh).  But its really the best that can kill us. They are either gonna compete decently well when they are playing or give the opponents a major lead. Thats how you get fascinating statlines like the starters being around +20 and the bench all being -5 to 10 on wins.\n",

      "Suns sort of did this to themselves though. They had CP3 and Ayton around Booker+KD still and got abysmal returns for both of them.  Beal was never going to be the answer to this team since you already have 2 bonafide scorers/offensive players in Booker+KD. The fit was questionable from the start and CP3 would've likely been a better fit.  Ayton, I know he had to be traded but I refuse to believe the best they could get for him was Nurkic\n",

      "They were contending favorites in all of the years after Harden left — stopped by injuries in 3 consecutive years to KD, Russ, Ibaka. Having Harden imo doesn't improve their chances when one of those 3 were out of the playoffs.  And then there were the OKC vs GSW years. They were good enough to win the ring in those years. KD was the one who gave up in the last series. I don't think Harden is a big difference maker there as Harden had the perfect team around him in his MVP years and still couldn't beat the Warriors. And those HOU teams were better fits for Harden than the OKC teams.  Summary: can't blame KD's failures on Harden trade. Outside of being carried by GSW, he was a chronic big game loser dating back to atleast college.\n",

      "I feel like a lot of what you said is revisionist or just incorrect.  Harden wasn’t MVP Harden, he was the 6th man super sub for the Thunder. Though I will agree that he was viewed as the Thunder’s 3rd.   Lamb was traded to the Thunder in the Harden trade but he was a rookie and I don’t recall him ever starting even though that may have happened. Frankly he never found his role with OKC. He certainly was never viewed as the 3rd piece along KD and Russ.  Kevin Martin was thought to be the 3rd piece after the trade for that season and from a production stand point, it kinda made sense. That didn’t come to fruition and Russ’ knee injury derailed the post season that year. Still, I think they were the 1 seed and one of the favorites to win the title pre-Russ injury.    The pick in the Harden trade turned into Steven Adams the next draft. Trading for waiters was a little desperate.  The Thunder didn’t have the assets to get much else. That happened in early 2015.    Your overall point that Presti made the wrong move by trading Harden though I think is pretty clearly correct or at the very least what most people think.  Why he was so quick to give up on running it back with the finals team, I’ll never know.\n",

      "Except veterans like him should know how to express frustration without the media getting wind of it, but since he's only been in Phoenix for a few months, he doesn't have enough good will within the organization for his complaints to remain internal. In a broader sense, wasn't Durant the one pushing for the FO to trade for Beal in the first place, despite him missing several games over the past few seasons? At his last three stops, KD has wanted the FO to trade away all depth to acquire another star, seemingly not realizing that an injury to that star would put so much of the burden, particularly the offensive, on him. So yes, while you can't directly blame him for this specific situation, he hasn't done himself any favors with how he's handled it.\n",

Actually, Steph and Bron have only won when their key contributors remained healthy for the run.

Low-key is kinda weird how few fans kd has for how fun n unique he is to watch. Everytime I watch him or see him show personality can’t help but like him till I remember that he kinda ruined bball for 17-18.5 for fans n others. Tho admittedly I got to avoid that mostly by being a much bigger fan since 2020 season.\n",

      "Nah, but people wouldn't have turned on his ability to be a number 1 the same way they are now if he hadn't left. For a few years after they won in 2017 and 2018 it was pretty common to see people say those titles elevated KD over Curry all time and that KD was the clear leader of those teams. In the past few years that sentiment has gotten quieter and quieter to the point I don't think I've seen it in a few months.   If KD had never left he'd still be viewed as the better player, may have 4 or 5 rings at this point, and would have been argued on the same level as Jordan, Kareem and Lebron.\n",

Once a player's career is over people look at its entirety in context and start to realize common narratives while they were playing aren't true which is why players like Melo and TMac are viewed so differently post career than they were while they were playing.

      "I said this several years ago and it definitely holds true today: Kevin Durant can't be made happy. You could give KD The Basketball Player the world and he'd be content for about a day before he started getting grouchy about it.  Maybe KD The Human Being is a happy, fulfilled person. But KD The Basketball Player is perpetually unhappy. There's nothing anyone can do to change that and teams should stop trying.   If he starts agitating to get out of PHX, they need to just say \"No. We mortgaged our future to get you and bring you supporting players you want. We're paying you $46mil per year to play basketball for us. You'll either do that, or forfeit the money. But we're not trading you.\"\n",

      "What I don't get is that the Suns didn't need KD. They just needed to replace CP3 somehow and figure out the Aytom situation. Mikal and Booker were scary and they're pretty damn young.  Instead they leveraged everything for a rapidly aging KD who's always unhappy and on top of that trade for the ghost of Beal. It made no sense.  Makes me really appreciate the Bucks owners who just let the GM cook.\n",

      "Kevin Durant is one of the most overrated superstars in nba history. He’s never led a team of his own to a championship. The only thing he’s ever done is ride Steph to two championships.   Now he goes to Phoenix & thought it would be an easy road to win with Beal and Booker. He can’t lead. They’re a .500 team with he and Booker playing most of the games.   He’s sensational as a talent but he’s not an all time great in terms of winning. I hope he proves me wrong this year but I’ll never understand why he’s thought of as one of the greats\n",

Agreed the suns bench and supporting cast sucks but that’s what happens in the first year of a team with 3 Max superstars.\n",

      "I was a big KD supporter for the first few years even though he didn't play for my team. He stuck with OKC for a long while and seemed humble and the anti-diva for forever, especially up until his tearful MVP speech. He was let down by the org in OKC. Presti made it a point to never get any good 3 and D guys (had a ton of 3 guys like Anthony Morrow who couldn't defend or D guys like Sefolosha and Roberson who were non-scorers), and then started Perkins who was another non-threat. So most of his OKC career they started two non-threats around him and Russ.   After that predictably fizzled out with no rings he quit on them, and determined himself to become a totally shameless ring chaser and armchair GM. He has been an embarrassment for a while now. Its almost brazen how shameless he has been about it. I feel like he is a bit like Bonds in that Bonds saw McGwire and Sosa taking roids so he did too in terms of watching LeBron go to Miami, then Cleveland and force the Love trade but he took it to an 11 last few years in terms of diva quitter bullshit. Even leaving GS mainly because he wasn't getting enough credit of all reasons\n",

Kevin Durant's IQ is off the charts though according to this sub. Skipping school and other developmental activities is not easily remedied with money as we can see.\n",

      "I love KD I really do think he was the best player in the world by far in the 2021 playoffs. His shot to enter the GOAT discussion was probably in the BKN tenure, in the first year there really was nothing he could have done, his supporting cast all got hurt. But that 2nd year _ if he was a better leader the whacky Harden and Irvint nonsense probably could have been avoided.\n",

Also Wemby just takes a bunch of bad shots off.   Yes Chet has a better team around him, but he is not the first or second option.   So it would be good to see how all this balances it out.\n",

The only advantage is getting to \"hang\" with the team, which is good for your mental, or maybe it just creates more pressure and buildup.

      ">Victor doesn't really have any open shots that he can choose to take because nobody else on the Spurs has the gravity or motion to pull defenders off of him.   That's just not true. I have watched almost every minute of his time in the NBA. He misses a ton of wide-open shots. He gets attention down low, like every big man, but no more than you'd expect for someone in the post. He's bad at getting into position also. Even the commentators who complain about him not getting the ball do it when his teammate just made an easy floater, Wembanyama is standing out at the 3-point line, where he's one of the worst shooters in the entire league, or when there's a defender in position to intercept.\n",

He sucks ass at shooting and he always has, it doesn't mean he always will, there's plenty of other things he is good at like his otherworldy defense but right now he's one of the worst chuckers in the entire league, even Tyrese Haliburton couldn't get this guy to stop chucking bricks.\n",

Weird that Spurs \"fans\" are the ones saying this too. Never seen so much coddling of a player before, it's ok to say he's ass at shooting right now.\n",
      "We were a sub .500 team last year and Giddey got way worse  We added chet and now after 27 games we’re 18-9   Wembrick’s team got worse they’re literally 4-23  Chet’s defensive numbers are better and his offensive numbers are fringe allstar when bricktor’s are league bottom  I don’t get how there’s an argument rn  It’s bc wemshit is hot and chef isn’t\n",
      "It just feels like cope that he isn't living up to the hype of the best prospect of all time tbh, they're desperately trying to rationalize how he's not KD, Lebron, and Luka all rolled up into 1 alien package and is in fact just a slightly more talented Bol Bol. It's pretty sad honestly. If he were this god's gift to basketball as he was hyped up to be he wouldn't need his team to feed him easy buckets all the time. We'll see how his career ends up but I have a feeling he's going to be pretty disappointing, honestly.\n",

      "Dude its not even a debate on who is better tf? Who really cares they both look great, but be completely honest do you think Chet would be having the same season if he played on the Spurs in Wembys place?  The Spurs have won 4 games this season, OKC has won 18. There is a whole heck of a lot more going on than Wemby holding his team back and Chet leading his team to 3 in the west so far.   At some point you just have to admit that context is important and stop trying to push nonsensical narratives about which rookie is better than which a whole 25 games into their careers.\n",
      "> but be completely honest do you think Chet would be having the same season if he played on the Spurs in Wembys place?  The Spurs would absolutely be better than their current record with Chet instead of Wemby. The team is literally worse this year. If Chet is on the Spurs he would have way higher volume and lower efficiency but still be impactful. I think he'd be putting up 22/9 on 59% TS instead of the 17/9 on 65% TS as a guess.  > The Spurs have won 4 games this season, OKC has won 18.  > There is a whole heck of a lot more going on than Wemby holding his team back and Chet leading his team to 3 in the west so far.  But this is ACTUALLY part of their teams performance. Wemby is literally the Spurs #1 option taking the most attempts and has near league worst efficiency. He has definitely costed them games, any other player with as poor efficiency as Wemby on as high volume would be absolutely crucified on this sub and blamed for their teams poor performance.  Similarly Chet is absolutely one of, if not the biggest reason for OKCs improvement this season. Yes the Thunder were better than the Spurs last year but going from .500 to top of the league is a huge improvement and he's a perfect piece for that squad with his defense and overall winning plays and attitude on the court. His individual talent is getting slightly overshadowed by SGA and the team. Having Chet as a second option is a massive advantage.\n",
      "> I think he'd be putting up 22/9 on 59% TS instead of the 17/9 on 65% TS as a guess.  His TS% isn't even 65 right now why do you feel the need to lie about something like this? This is pathetic on so many levels.\n",

      "Spurs fan here. I do think Wemby has a higher ceiling, and hopefully will work on his flaws, but he definitely has them.  _ his shot selection is not that great yet. Not a coincidence that his best games were playing the Suns, where he later commented that it was inspiring watching Durant be patient and get into his spots. Wemby tends to rush his shots and often forces things.  _ for a player who has played pro already his finishing ability is still lacking, He will often miss bunnies. I suspect partly the differences in FIFA and NBA baskets, but I hear he was not great with that in France either.  _ for those saying he lacks a PG, while that is true, that mostly changes the number of shots, not the efficiency.  That is ok, he will improve over time, especially with an offseason to improve.  Also note that there are advantages to not having a PG. Note the number of times Wemby brings up the ball instead of our nominal PG. He would not get that chance otherwise.  Also note that he has many other strengths that also offset: he is great shot blocking instincts and other shot deterring defense, is super smooth with moving and dribbling.\n",
      "Not just his blocking abililty, but his length allowing him to get steals is probably the best in the league already by a wide margin.\n",

      ">Chet would be just as inefficient   See. This is my issue with this debate. Because it’s not rooted in actual truthfulness   Chet shoots better. He shoots better from the line. He shoots better open. He shoots better contested.   Yes, Wemby is on a poor team. But y’all have over exaggerated and diminished how good of a rookie shooter Chet Holmgren is and it is absolutely getting to levels of ridiculousness.\n",
      "What do you mean yall? Haha the debate is moot. All of what you just said is based on the reality in which the debate happens in.   I’m happy we have Chet but why continue with this narrative. Who cares? Let our guys cook and quit trying to compare to others in the league\n",
      "Y’all as in the people that keep pushing this narrative.   That’s not the point. I get you want to look like the super objective OKC fan but it’s weird y’all have pushed this narrative like people who play with Shai are just automatically great shooters or something lol.   Wemby was a bad shooters overseas. He’s a bad shooter now. Chet was a good shooter in college. He’s a good shooter now.   And that’s fine to say.\n",
      "It’s just a much better team in position to compete so obviously people within that system will benefit.  I think that’s the main point I’m trying to make. Chet is not the focal point. Wemby is, and the teams round him is trash.  We don’t know what Chet would look like as the focal point on a trash team cause he is fortunate enough to not be in that situation.\n",

      "Sure. I guess my point is I hate comparing both on the surface but it’s inevitable given their age and similar body build.  I hate seeing posts that try to diminish wemby comparing directly to a player putting up better numbers in a better situation.

      "The biggest drawback to VW's ROY big is his efficiency, or lack thereof.   I imagine that, as the season goes along, that will improve, and next year, we'll get a better picture of how efficient VW will be moving forward.  But Chet is in here shooting at an All-NBA level efficiency from the get go: Over .600 inside the arc, a killeer .850 from the charity stripe, and a respectable .360 from the arc.   &#x200B;  VW has raise his % inside the arc to a respectable .500, and his FT is a respectable .770, but the three-point shooting is a dismal .280 (and I'm rounding up).   But just moving him to center was his FG% increase.   VW is ahead on boards, steals, and blocks, but not by such a significant margin that I think it will tip the ROY balance into his favour.   There is also the fact that Chet is doing this on a team that is one of five teams that still only have single digit loses and is near the top of a touch western conference.   But it is a long season, and VW seems like a quick study.  Regardless, we as fans are in for a treat to watch these to talents throughout their careers.\n",

      "I'm a noted Hinkie defender but his biggest mistake was letting it get so public. In justifying himself and his plan to angry fans he advertised the most public tank job the league had ever seen and it ultimately ruined everything he had worked for. Silver gave us the Colangelos who pissed away all the assets Hinkie had built up over the Process and stagnated what could have been a dynasty in another world.   Even though I get it, it still pisses me off that more recent tanking teams haven't been getting punished like we did. Teams can basically be as obvious as they want but get off scot-free just because they don't literally say \"we are tanking lol.\"\n",

      "Lol really doubt that dude. I play almost every weekend (in an area in the South that produces a lot of of bball talent) and once made my first seven warm up shots in a row. That was my record but I've also done five a couple times too.   These aren't just layups, midrange shots and the occasional 3 included. Only reason they let won't let me try out for the nba or g-league or whatever is because of my multi-substance addiction issues but honestly I've had em for so long they don't give me any kind of competitive advantage. If anything I'm actually handicapping myself by often having an upset stomach (makes it hard to ball out unless you're Jordan).  Point being, if I come into the league like this I should be treated fairly like everyone else. No one's not allowed to play hockey because they're depressed or be a football lineman because you eat way too much food, and those things are way bigger advantages than me ever doing research chemicals to sleep have been. I'm fine with working with my coach on getting sober but that might take a while with the amount of shit I'm on so I'd prefer to be eligible while I'm in my prime.  If anyone knows a lawyer that would be willing to take on my case pro bono, I can send over my stats to prove that I really can ball and have a case that's worth taking on. I can also include my lastest tox screen to prove I'm not just a good player looking to get away with smoking weed in the NBA or some lame shit.  Like I could probably cheat the system and rotate around a couple smaller G-league rosters (or maybe even make the NBA who knows) for a while but I'm not about that. I want to play straight up, these are my issues, here's what I can provide for your team, y'know real honest shit. It just sucks it'll take someone like me to go through the legal system in order to set future precedent. Imagine if this generations LeBron couldn't get eligible because he couldn't stop taking kratom or some shit. It would be a tragedy. And I want to help prevent a future kid from going through that hardship.\n",
