      "Harden had a 53/16/17 (54/56/89 splits) game against the knicks at the end of 2016 according to stat muse\n",
      "Harden was unreal in 2018-2020 seasons. That was his peak.  Luka also had a 60+21+10 game last season on 67% fg.   Thing is Luka at 24 years is not even his prime yet.\n",
      "Yeah Luka took his superstar leap earlier than Harden did so I'm sure he'll have more absurd stat lines by the end of his career vs Harden\n",
      "luka never even leaped he came into the league as a superstar. was obvious since day one  that’s why he’s the only guy we have who has the potential to be the greatest ever by the end of his career\n",
      "He really is insanely gifted and well poised to break records. Already having 10K points this soon seems crazy to me. I normally don't like to label someone as potential GOAT because a lot of things can go sideways, but Luka definitely is on that path. Absolutely special player.\n",
      "As good as he is Luka will likely never even break the top 5. Kevin Durant has been a scoring machine for 15 years and wouldn’t make most people’s top 5, let alone GOAT. He is a special, special talent but a lot of excellence and importantly, luck and timing, will need to happen before he can enter that conversation\n",
      "Luka is better than Durant and will end higher in the history for sure. Durant is way more efficient scorer, nothing more. Luka only needs a ring as the best player in the team ( he will except if he teams up with Jokic) to surpass Durant.   Luka scores less efficient but at a higher volumen, plus the rebounds, assists, playmaking… Durant is a weapon, Luka is the machine engine on itself, the weapon, the general and the system. Durant wasn’t in top3 convos at the age of Luka.\n",
      "Durant was a 3 time scoring champion and led his team to the finals before he turned 24. It’s frankly ludicrous to claim Luka is better than Durant has been at any age other than maybe the last couple of years.\n",
      "Bruh KD also had a significantly better team than Luka has ever had. I know it’s popular to hate on Russ but he was a legitimate stud and was playing at a significantly higher level than anyone Luka’s played with. That’s not even accounting for Serge and Harden\n",
      "Are we really saying, 6 years into Luka’s career where he has achieved nothing on an individual level as good as KD, that he’s better than KD was at this stage? This is ridiculous lmao. Probably the most dynamic scorer in NBA history who fits into the flow of an offense either as the lead option or as a 2nd or 3rd against Luka who has up to now showed ZERO ability to play without the ball in his hands. I love Luka but he’s ineffective if he’s not running the show.\n",

Two time Finals MVP.\n",
      "Iguodala was the best player too because he has the FMVP??? he joined a 73-9 team the year before, a team that knew what was winning rings. While they doubled Curry, Durant scored like he always did. That’s not being the best player in a championship team. Because the years he wasn’t with curry, he demonstrated he couldn’t be the guy in a championship team. Curry won without Durant, before, with him, and after. Durant without curry is swapping super teams ?\n",

Second, Luka is in the 3 best man talks for 3 years, around Jokic Giannis (both will end as top15 history with his actual accomplishments) and with embiid the actual mvp in the convo after last year. His team robbed mvps, with his regular season stats and covered with epic playoff performances, Luka is at that level. If he has better record than embiid jokic or giannis he is the mvp. Is the deciding factor with the 4 monsters.   As much as I love Luka I doubt he ends as the goat, if even Lebron James can’t… but he is the only one in the race right now, with the potential to be the goat if everything goes perfect on his career.\n",

      "Yep. We shouldn't ignore that despite Luka huge talent, considering the offense we are watching today these statline are going to be less and less absurd to see.  When Harden had 36ppg in 2018-19, leading the league in scoring, the 2nd best was Paul George with 28ppg. I mean, that's a crazy gap between the scoring leader and the 2nd one.  back to the 10-15 years ago a 40 triple double was already a crazy accomplishment. But I mean, already a triple double alone was quite a performance. Today is just too common.  That been said, I'm curious to see how good peak Luka is going to be.\n",

      "Pretty sure this Lukas prime ; all the areas guys griej into or use athleticism in are not gonna aid him like ffs his second year in the league was his best run attach n finishing season and like judt behind this year n last in most metrucs n imo eye test secondary’s Rokus he fit to the rim consistently., Lukas real growth will be improving defensively more imo I don’t think he’ll ever be a sniperbthe ft % and other indicators mean he’s good enough there to worry bout but not enough to have some extra shooting lvl . Fitness n defence coukd taje Luka into toop 3 .\n",
      "Generally the prime is considered the moment when you are peaking physically and you also have enough experience to be a complete player from a technical standpoint.  So Luka having the same athleticism he has now but with much more experience and being more mature would be the moment he reaches his peak. Almost nobody reaches his peak at 24 years. Usually we talk about 27-28 years. Then of course you start to slow down physically while your skills can even improve.  I think between him and Jokic we have two players that can play like this for a lot of years since they don't rely on overwhelm opponents with elite athleticism. Jokic probably will be able to play like he does now even at 35 years.  &#x200B;  \\*I noticed we are talking about two different things. I was writing having the peak in mind. You were talking about the prime. Maybe you're right then.\n",

      "This is a ridiculous take...  In his prime Harden was the most skilled player in the NBA. He had elite footwork, finishing, passing, deceleration, post defense, mid range game, and iso game. He only missed 43 games over 8 seasons in Houston while averaging ~37 mpg. Go check and see how many games Luka missed in his first three seasons with the Mavs and how many mpg he plays.  Almost every night Harden was efficient and put up numbers, and every year he put Houston teams, nearly always full of nobodies, on his back and carried them to the playoffs. You can't do that without an insane level of skill.   Luka is amazing, and maybe one day he can say he had a better career than Harden, but at the moment their resumes aren't even close.\n",
      "He has skill. But you can't deny that he had that athleticism. Luka on the other hand just relies on skill and BBIQ. For the most part on Harden's career he had a respectable roster with him to contend, but got blocked by the Warriors. Luka until now hasn't really had a really good roster (Powell at the 5 for the most part) since he arrived in the league. For the injuries and availability I won't contest that.\n",

      "Makes me worried about Luka’s chances at a title. I forgot who it was, but someone said about harden that an offense that’s so single-dimensional was easier to stop in the playoffs when the defensive intensity is turned up and the focus just has to be on one guy. Kyrie obviously helps… but I don’t like seeing Luka’s usage rate so high. Also makes me worried about him getting run into the ground like harden.\n",
      "I disagree. Harden's big problem is that getting to the foul line was a SIGNIFICANT percentage of his offensive repertoire. In the playoffs, refs call less fouls. That killed a big part of his offensive game. Luka's skill at rim finishing, his post up game and mid range shooting, is far superior to Harden's and closer to Lebron's which makes him much more difficult to stop than Harden come playoff time. His bag is larger. He doesn't rely so heavily on a single scoring aspect like getting to the line to keep his scoring consistent.\n",

      "Nah I'm sorry but harden imo isn't like Luka. He doesn't make the team he's on better, and I feel like Luka does and is generally more consistent and just overall a better teammate. Prolly much more fun to play with on the daily and just looks to enjoy it more and people enjoy watching him more and playing beside him.   Harden imo just never really gave off those vibes.   I'm sure harden 1 on 1 is that dude. I know he has skills. But I've just always seen him as a guy that coulda been. Just something off... I know he's a bit eccentric and that's ok. I'm sure he's fun as I've seen it.   But overall hands down I'd take Luka 10 times out of 10 over harden.\n",

      "The similarities are in PnR, step back game and pace of play. The big difference is in post up and mid range scoring. Harden didn't really have one. Luka's scoring game in the paint is much more similar to Lebron James than it is Harden.  For reference Harden shot 63.8% at the rim and 37.7% between 3-10 feet over his career. Luka by comparison shoots 72.8% at the rim, and 50.7% between 3-10 feet out. Luka also shoots a clearly better percentage from the mid range than Harden did. Harden got to the FT line more (really the primary basis of his scoring), and shot FT at a better rate.  Luka's post up and mid range game was SIGNIFICANTLY superior to Harden's and gives him a deeper scoring bag than Harden ever had. Which will IMO always make Luka more difficult to contain than Harden, because all you had to do with Harden is find a way not to foul him and you dry up a big portion of his scoring. That tactic doesn't work with Luka.\n",

      "Im gonna be downvotes to oblivion but Lebron never scored and assisted at the rate Luka does it, strictly statistically speaking\n",
      "Per possession they are fairly close in some years as Bron scratched the 40 per 100 quite often where Luka often is in the 41-43 per 100 range. I'd also include LeBrons playoff resume which is stronger during several post season runs of his. Additionally LBJ peaked before the spacing revolution so cutting him some slack is warranted in my opinion. There's also the issue of Bron having played most of his prime years on stronger rosters with a larger spread on scoring, like his Miami years and second Cleveland stint. In 2009 when Bron played on a bad roster he scored over 47 per 100 in 14 playoff games, a mark Doncic hasn't reached yet. So to me they are definitely close enough to include both  In terms of points generated and AST% they are very similar, as of right now LeBron peaked even slightly higher than Luka.\n",

He basically took over the backup center minutes for a stretch before he had some injuries. He was a solid team defender that provided some secondary rim protection, could get you a few buckets on cuts/transition, and he played with good energy. The only thing keeping him for being even better was the shooting. He was streaky and had the occasional game with a couple 3s, but he has been much more consistent this year.

Fans loved him as a high flyer energy guy and wanted that lob as a go to option but by that point the offense was very slow and methodical with Dame/Nurkic PNR, Dame/CJ isos, 3 point shooting from Dame, CJ, Simons, Powell, Melo. There just weren't a lot of good options for DJJ with all those mouths to feed in that style of offense. What we really needed was defense and RoCo was the better option there. Surprised to see he started 43 games, I remember him being pretty marginal with fans asking for more. Thrilled to see he's balling out with Luka.

      "If he was shooting 36% on 4 attempts he’d have played more, a big problem for him with the blazers was he wasn’t hitting the three with any consistency and that made it a problem because it made it easier for teams to load up on dame with little punishment.   For DJJ on the blazers to work better he’d have had to be able to drive on his own off of kickouts, but he wasn’t very good at that then so he kinda fell out of rotation for carmelo iirc   RoCo really sold on those dunks lmao\n",
      "It didn't seem like we were able to punish the double as much as we should have with teams picking up Dame at half—with Dame also being the primary facilitator it often felt like a different guy taking the 3 or settling for a CJ middie was our best option. Would have loved to see more easy buckets generated from beating the double but that blazers team had to work for every one. A cutter like DJJ could have thrived with a secondary star facilitating imo but that wasn't really CJ's game and we didn't have enough speed or ball movement in general to break down defenses and reward his off ball movement. I bet he'd be a great fit with the young guns now. As you say it would have worked better if DJJ could drive or shoot outside, and as the other guy said it would have helped a lot if Dame was 6'8\" and could see over/pass out of the trap.\n",
      "it broke down exactly for those reasons, dame wasn't big enough to over come the overall lack of balance / spread on the floor offensively.   CJ was just a tad too unreliable sadly\n",

It’s literally not his fault if the options he had to pass to were shit. RocO missed two wide open dunks in his 55 11 game lmao   Like I said luka is better but it’s definitely not my miles   It’s more stemming from the fact he is literally bigger, but that’s less passing abilty and just having better angles imo  It’s also inedible classic for someone to say someone is so much better than someone else, they bring ups stats to have an objective conversation and they OF COURSE say “it’s not about the stats” LOLOLOOOLIOOLOL\n",

      "That's *why* you trade him. He has value on that contract, if he made $20m/yr no one would want him. I know the Bulls are 9-4 since LaVine went down, but that doesn't change the fact that they should be selling hard at the deadline.\n",
      "I think having a competent roster helps the development of guys like White and Williams. I think bulls should get rid of Vuc and Lavine but keep DeMar.\n",
      "In principle, yeah, I agree that having veteran talent helps guys develop. In practice, the Bulls really need a legit franchise guy, and I don't really see either Williams or White becoming that level of player. They don't necessarily need to move everyone at the trade deadline, but next year they should be looking at the top of the 2025 draft.\n",
      "In the 13 game stretch their point differential would put them approximately on par with Milwaukee in the East and the Nuggets in the West (just behind both teams).   And that isn't just beating up on bad teams, they beat Milwaukee, NO, Miami, @76ers, Lakers, in that stretch. Lost to Milwaukee in OT, Denver, @Miami and Clevaland (even though they played nobody, lololol).  They don't have the 'guy' but they're playing like a 4 or 5 seed in either conference right now. I'm not really playing the selling game if they're playing like that — other than LaVine. Even if it means the path to championship contender is nil, that's a good enough team that you don't purposefully get worse imo. Otherwise you should be arguing for teams like the Knicks and Cavs and Magic and Pacers to all blow it up too, as they clearly don't have the franchise guy that wins you outplays Steph Curry or Giannis, etc.\n",
      "I respect it but still pretty bizarre path of mediocrity to be on and the bulls are not in any way comparable to those teams you listed. Teams like the Cavs, Pacers, Magic have obviously more talented young players with tremendous upside. The bulls don’t have a talent like Hali, Paulo, Garland, or Mobley. The Magic are the 4th youngest team, Pacers 7th, Cavs 13th, and Knicks 14th. The bulls (23rd in age) actually have an older roster than the lakers (22nd) lol.  As a laker fan I have absolutely no interest in Lavine and I pray we don’t trade for him. But I do think trading your older players makes a lot more sense than whatever is going on now.\n",
      "The most important thing is for the young guys to keep getting playing time to vet their long-term worth.  We just aren't going to get a top pick in '24.\n",
      "Coby White is pretty good. Blowing it up is also not the only the solution, you got teams rebuilding for decades with no luck. Weirdly the bulls have a lot of pieces without having the big star.\n",

There's some mindset of \"make your team trash so by year 6 you might have something...\" but that pretty much is random did you pick the right future top-5 player whcih is only in every ~3 drafts scam mentality.

Gives away dumb fouls, sometimes refs just blow garbage whistles, 3 ball isn’t super great, and overall doesn’t move enough off ball. Weirdly isn’t much of a lob threat.  I have a strong feeling he’d be better on a team if he had less responsibilities. The problem with Hawks is it’s Trae and no true second option, so the guys that are definitely not a second option get exposed badly. Murray was supposed to help but is inconsistent and not much of a playmaker.\n",

Clearly stated.   It certainly felt more like a 1a and 1b situation.   Now comparing Kat to Love is hard because the wolves sucked hard while he was there. But then again the Wolves sucked hard until Ant got there.   You explain to me why Kat is so much better than love.\n",

I can just tell you I’ve never seen Love leading teams anywhere as #1 option, that’s why I think KAT is a better player (you don’t have to agree with me, I can be biased). Not in Wolves, not in Cavs after Lebron left. KAT was the best player on 21-22 squad that whole offense was built around. He was an All-Star without a doubt while Ant was competing for the replacement spot and lost to Dejounte.\n",

I think the argument has often be chocked up to him not having the drive to go even further, there’s no next level. He’s just who he is on the court. He’ll get you 20/10 shooting the lights out but his defense is passable at best and he doesn’t give you much else.

      "yet Jazz had a better DRTG with Gobert on the bench for his ENTIRE playoff career  do you think it changed on Wolves last postseason? (hint: no)\n",
      "Wouldn’t that be a result of the lineups he played with and against? Gobert, by virtue of his importance to both Minny and Utah, played against opposing teams best players and **with** his teams best players, many of whom were often average to awful defensively.   Let’s take 2020 with the Jazz for instance as just a random roster. Starting lineup for the majority of the year of Ingles, DMitchell, Bojan, Royce, and Gobert. Of that lineup, Ingles and Bojan are genuinely bad defenders, DMitchell is a passable one who sometimes fluctuates between awful and spectacular, and Royce is (or at least was, he may have regressed by now) a good defender. And then you had Gobert as the lynchpin of their defense.   When his expectation is to cover for the inadequacies of both Ingles and Bojan (or, later, a Mike Conley who was having a lot of struggles that year to the extent that many thought he was washed before he got back to his winning play the following year) while also compensating for Donovan putting all of his attention to the offensive end and taking a lot of plays off defensively…it makes an enormous amount of sense that the defense wouldn’t actually thrive with him on the court, because his defensive talent was being utilized to cover for multiple players simultaneously. When Gobert wasn’t on the floor, neither were the opposing teams best players for the most part, so most of the inadequacies that he was forced to cover up were much less of a factor.   I don’t understand how people could watch those Jazz teams year after year and come away with the conclusion that Rudy was the most impactful defender on the court every minute he was on the court. His defense failing to actually cover for an entire team is not an indictment of him, but of the roster construction of those teams that still made it pretty far, all things considered.   If he fails to translate it this year, assuming he and the current Wolves starting unit go into the playoffs healthy, then we’ll have a pretty good argument for playoff basketball nullifying him despite his regular season success. But he’s been on teams for most of his career that have had him surrounded by bad defenders, teams that he still made into good to great defenses almost entirely off of his own skill set.\n",
      "You were close on your assessment of our defenders. Ingles was the passable one, depending on the matchup (snatched Paul George's spirit in the playoffs), while Donovan was straight up terrible on D. Bojan is legit terrible, except against methodical wings like Kawhi, oddly enough. However, all of them struggled to keep guys in front of them off the dribble and most of them struggled to navigate screens.  Royce was indeed good, but overworked and asked to do too much.  The other main issue was simply the overall size of the personnel. We probably could have been fine running some combination of Conley, Mitchell, Royce, Bojan out there, but only if one or two of them were swapped for a roaming power forward (think JJJ or Mobley) or a defensive plus bigger guard (Jrue Holiday or Caruso).\n",

      "When I see Embiid play as he is now it reminds me of how I used to play and it is frustrating and pisses me off that the NBA allows it. Not proud of it, I was known as Shaq on my local streetball court and went through a phase when I charged hard at everything. Big hard turns to my blindside, didn't care who was there. Charge right into the lane. Smash into the best offensive player on D while going for the ball, come what may. Limited offensive moves. So make no mistake about it. Embiid knows what he's doing. He knows people will be injured. He knows his skillset is limited and this is how he can win. He knows people will give way when he drives, think twice on their drives, etc. He will only be stopped by a stronger player and/or fearless players like Giannis, Gasol, Draymond, etc. Or by an obviously more skilled player with equal Type A like Ibaka. He didn't intend to injure, but he certainly intends to show you that he doesn't care if you get hurt when he rumbles into you. At least that's how I used to play. But that was streetball. Eventually I got more moves, played w better players, played real basketball w refs. There's no doubt in my mind the NBA has some kind of edict coming down, telling the refs to let him run amok.\n",

Giving Cade Ivey (who isn't a great shooter, but he can get to the rim at ease which means he can't be ignored) and Bogey (who is a great shooter) has immediately solved Cades efficiency problems and his TO are way down as well.  I can't imagine how good he would be with 3 knockdown shooters and Duren or with Stew as the stretch 5.\n",

Yes maybe in 2048 when the cybernetic athletes have actual pistons in their body they will be competitive again but I'll be too busy in the helium mines on Jupiter to watch the games.\n",

Not too long ago lolkings was the most commented shit one every Kings post and Dearron Fox was considered a huge bust.   The Pistons are currently in one the worst rebuilds the NBA has ever seen, with the fewest NBA caliber players of any non-Bobcats team. If the team that literally just set the record for basketball futility is \"less than ideal\", what qualifies as a bad team to you?  Also De'aaron Fox was never considered a bust.\n",

The only way he could potentially get the ball rolling on a trade is if he threatened to not sign an extension + said he would sit out games due to \"injuries\" until he got moved. But I don't see that happening at all so he's probably just gonna be more like Devin Booker on the Suns but with less realistic hope of a real turnaround IMO\n",

      "Monty coming out of the timeout with a contested Burks 3 was mind boggling to me.  I’ve had my fair share of wtf moments in the last two decades with the Kings but the coaches we had were less than ideal.  Always going for the cheap hire because of the Maloofs.  Monty is considered a “premium” hire and that’s the shit he comes out with.  $70M woof.\n",

Not only do the Pistons not have anyone that would start over any player on the Celtics, it’s debateable if they have any player that would be 6th or 7th man on their roster over Horford and Hauser.   Spurs have Vassell, Wemby, and Johnson. Wizards have Kuzma, Jones, and Gafford. I think all 6 of those players would be the best player in Detroit if they were on that team, and those are players from the other 2 clear worst teams in the league.

      "> Monty Williams was signed with that mega contract so he could max out the team’s potential- have them overperform.  You're right about this, but you are totally wrong on the timeline. There is no way you think they were primed to compete year 1. That's not the idea here. Monty is meant to grow with these guys and the pieces they add. This is basically a tanking year as it is. If Monty has any directive, its probably closer to \"losing is better right now\" than the opposite. I think there is a reason he is so willing to just experiment with lineups and concistently does stuff like run all bench. Its not an accident.\n",

      "Pretty spot on.   I live in NY and lower bowl seats start at like $800 before the bullshit add-on fees and taxes. Multiply by 2 cause its weird going alone. If you go with your partner, they want to grab decent dinner, drinks, etc. and the total ends up being $2,000 (being conservative).  I am never going to a game, even if I win the lottery.\n",
      "We go once or twice a season. Living in Vegas you can get to Phoenix, LA, or Utah pretty easily. But it just keeps getting more expensive. We were planning on going to a playoff game this year but said screw it and got Rolling Stones tickets instead. Being a clippers fan is annoying too, I’ve never seen us win a game and I’ve never seen the whole team healthy.\n",

Like when the passes get weaker/easier to steal , defensive rotations are dysfunctional because they stop communicating or because chemistry is sinking, players just go through motions with no energy and it starts to feel like they are playing at the High School level?   Because this is usually what happens as losing streaks start to run their course on teams (and its so frustrating for fans).\n",

      "This is what Red said, but there’s no facts or basis in reality as to what happened. Rochester passed on Russell because:  1. They already has a defensive-first, athletic forward in Maurice Stokes, who was very good and had a promising career ahead of him that was cut short by a tragic on court accident, and 2. The Royals owner saw Russell play in person in a collegiate all star game in NYC and Russell had an off night, and 3. Russell had already committed to the Olympics and would miss the first half of his rookie year, plus he was being courted by the Globetrotters and the word on the street was that he’d demand a $50,000+ salary to go to the NBA, which was too rich for the Royals\n",

      "> They got the most losses in MLB history with the Tigers (162 game season)  Most losses was the 62 Mets who went 40-120-1 (with a rainout which is why they missed a game) , so the Tigers dodged that one. Of course the 62 Mets were also a brand new expansion team so they had an excuse, while the Tigers were over 100 years old at that point.\n",

      "There's no way it gets that high. That's the longest losing streak in NBA history immediately followed by another all-time historic losing streak. They're bad, but they're still a professional team (I think....). At some point they'll have a good night and the other team will have a bad night and they'll find a way to win.  I won't lie though I'm rooting for it to go as high as possible. I love when historic stuff like this happens.\n",

      "Yeah I was once on a middle school league team and we got blown out every single game despite “cheating” by having a dominating 6’2” guy somehow join our tournaments through a loophole.  It’s just that everybody else doesn’t play well together nor did most of us really even like each other. Most of the guys were just total dicks. We lacked all effort. We also got blown out by the women’s team all the time too, and honestly not surprising with how talented, cohesive, and motivated the women’s team was.\n",

Even then you still have your country cup and secondary cup (though top clubs don't exactly care about the secondary cup),which sometimes means more than winning the league. Soccer is more than just winning due to the team basically being apart of the community and the history behind that.

      "As a fan of both the nba, premier league and scottish football its interesting. It's impossible to deny that scottish football is a complete mess (even coming from someone who follows celtic), the game is on the brink of dying up here, so much so that there have been calls to move rangers and celtic to the english league. Most premier league fans don't have a huge problem with a handful of teams being in close contention for the title every season, the problem is when a team starts running away with it for several years in a row (Man city in recent times). This does make it all the more exciting when there is an upset though (i.e leicester and Blackburn). This season is shaping up to be a lot more interesting however, with underdogs aston villa making a push for top 4 if not the title. I support West Ham first and foremost (I live in scotland hence why I have a scottish team as well), we are often in relegation scraps which are exciting in their own way, it makes each win feel worth more than if you are a shit nba team rebuilding. We've been doing good the last couple of seasons, getting into european football and that has been incredible to watch, so I would argue that it by no means makes it less interesting to watch for fans of the not big teams.\n",

      "Although that's true for most european leagues, a consequence of this is that fans have vastly different expectations for their teams. Teams in the mid-table dream of reaching the european competition spots, while low table teams are satisfied in escaping relegation and beating the big teams on home turf. For many teams the thrill of being in the first division is watching your team go up against the big boys in a match of much higher quality than where they were before  Not to say the huge cash injection that has entered the european (and american) game over the last 20 years isn't a problem, it definetly is and has taken a lot from previously competitive leagues like the french league and prem. Even the brazillian league, which is known for having the highest parity of the bigger leagues, where most matches can go both ways on the day and where almost every team has been relegated, has seen it's financial gaps growing year by year because of business practices related to the euopean game.  The main complaint had against the american draft/no relegation model is that it removes any kind of stakes from competition and rewards teams for being bad, but in the end it's just a matter of different sports cultures\n",

It has mostly to do with the very problematic governing body of european footy, UEFA, and an attemp to create a new champions league without affiliation to them.   The original proposal outlined a 20 team first division with 15 of them being protected from relegation for a set number of years in a bottom-2 relegation system. In that case, it would be almost impossible for many of them to not benefit from the clause, to the point where it apparently has been scaled back in the proposal that came out last week\n",

      "Relegation is a terrible system that is used as a distraction for how top-heavy the leagues are. The Premier League has more or less 8 good teams out of 30 and that is competitive when you compare it to Italy and Spain (3 or 4), France (like 2), and Germany (literally 1 team has won the league the last 12 years). A low tomid-tier team will pretty much never win the league but for a once-in-50-year miracle like Leicester. But congrats you can celebrate over not getting demoted! Yeah! So instead of developing your own young talent or investing in up-and-coming players on transfer _ things that will result in losing as you develop those players and build for the future _ instead you spend all of your money on middling veteran talent so you can be a middling team and not get demoted. Meanwhile the rich competitive teams buy the young players and develop them on the sidelines because they  This sub loves to talk about how teams like the Wizards, Hornets, etc are pepetually mediocre because they did just that and always finished 7th to 10th. Well, guess what? That is what relegation would get you. Fans of those kinds of european teams are brainwashed into thinking that mediocre is good. Because it could be worse! At least they're in the top flight league. The fact that American teams will commit to losing in order to, generally, try and develop and get better it part of why American leagues have so much parity. Worst to 1st is a thing. And as much as you might thinking \"rebuilds\" and \"tanking\" are dirty words, it's a good strategy. It still requires a competent front office and to actually hit on your young players. The failures are just misses.\n",
      "Being able to gain advantages by intentionally losing makes a complete mockery of the spirit of competition.\n",
      "I mean, it's objectively better for parity (ie, the good type of competition). Bundesliga for example has had the same champion for the past ten years. What is even the point of that league? Premier league is one of the most parity major leagues in Europe ironically, but it's still less competitive than NBA. NBA's far from perfect but I'll take the 2nd to 5th lowest seeds having a race to the bottom over relegation any-day. NBA has the least parity of major NA leagues too.\n",
      "The point is to support your team, because teams are a hell of a lot more connected to your community than American sports franchises. And you're not just competing for the league title, if you get one of the top spots you're qualifying for the European competitions and you have domestic cups as well.  Why should parity be the be all end all in sports? The point of sports is that the best person or team wins, can you imagine if the person with the worst qualifying time in the 100m sprint got to start 20 meters in front of the rest of the field just for paritys sake?\n",

It doesn't actually \"work\" in any competitive sense.   And it's literally getting less competitive by the season. Because the Premeir League is making more money than ever, the parachute payments are bigger than ever and so is the gap between Tier 2 teams.

I'm no coach, but it's usually pretty clear why they make the decisions they do. But that simply ain't the case here. Why he's jerking around players' minutes and running such random line-ups is beyond me.\n",

They were arguing that just because cade has low efficiency, that people thought he was trash. The reason his efficiency was low is because his team sucks, not him.  I know it was worded vaguely and a bit confusingly, but I think two seconds of thought would allow y'all to realize that no one is arguing that high efficiency is a bad thing. They're arguing that low efficiency isn't the best barometer for a guy who's on a shitty team\n",

      "He’s not well below. He started off slow but has been becoming more efficient as the season has progressed. First ten games clearly needed to get his legs back. Last 17 he’s been 23/4/7 on 46/35/88. Cade is showcasing why he was the unquestioned number one pick of his draft now imagine if he didn’t have to play with Killian Hayes, James wiseman, and the ghost of Alex Burks most this season\n",
      "I checked, that 17 game run is still below league average (well, pretty much average at -0.5ts%). Besides, he has been consistently below average efficiency player for his career, a 17 game run aint enough to change my mind. With that being said, he is still a very skilled player and I definitely can see him becoming all star or more.\n",
      "Being near average true shooting with what he has to play with is a miracle. He’s clearly getting better in spite of this roster. Matthew Stafford 2.0.\n",

      "A combination of stats and watching games. If his efficiency is bad then its worth looking into stuff like usage, what kind of pressure is getting applied to him etc. while also watching games to see how the team runs with him on the court   If you look at both I personally feel its pretty clear he's being held back immensely by the Pistons and is basically taking himself to the point of exhaustion just to try and keep them in a lot of games. Really hard to say if he's a potential top 5 level talent yet but definitely a co-star on a really good team IMO\n",
      "He played incredibly efficiently tonight.\n",
      "More talking about people trashing his efficiency in general especially when playing better teams. Tonight he was making a lot of tough shots because of lack of spacing and thats extremely hard to maintain for all but the most elite of the elite scorers in the league  So him having rougher efficiency overall isn't necessarily indicative of his ability to be an elite player given the roster. It just means he's sometimes being asked to do a crazy amount with very little to work with which is gonna lead to less consistency in terms of efficiency\n",

      "There just wasn't really a reason to do it so meticulously back then. At least not in a form you could quickly access. Most people were content with a basic newspaper box score. The ESPN bottom line was considered revolutionary when it debuted and that wasn't until 2002; and didn't have anywhere close to that level of detail.   It wasn't until the advent of the internet for the masses that there was big demand for stats like that. Nobody was really compiling those sort of stats until there was a demand for it.\n",
      "Also, computational power had huge increases in the mid-2000's that made it worth trying.

But more important than the computing power of an individual unit was the collective computing power of the population as a whole. Now instead of 1 or 2 statisticians in a dimly lit room working for a team/league/media entity or whatever you have an entire collective of statisticians and sports nerds watching games and compiling information and then programmers to make the data work best for us. Not to mention most statisticians in the 60's were still doing it the old fashioned way on pencil and paper. Computers were very much a foreign concept to most of that generation.   To my knowledge computer literacy in classrooms didn't become widespread until well into the 90's.\n",

      "And, as crazy as it sounds, he's the one of that trio that makes the most sense to roster and give even low-end rotation minutes to. He's arguably the worst of them on the court, sure, but you can at least make the argument that he was in the least favorable situation for his development, and that maybe playing on a lower end team where he has the leeway to make mistakes and learn would help turn him into an actual NBA player (especially given the fact he didn't really play much in college, either).   Knox and Bagley, though? They've been basically all you could want to develop, and they're both still not good at all _ and, more importantly, don't have any of the hustle, energy, work ethic, etc. that you'd expect from a low end rotational player to balance that out. They're also old enough to where they pretty much are the players they're going to be for the most part.\n",

      "I'm an alum of the University of Oregon.  In 2016 the Ducks football team was having it's worst year in quite a while, while one of our rivals the Washington Huskies were having their best year.  When we played Washington we wore blue and gold as a tribute to our state flag or something.  Oregon's colors are normally green and yellow, and when you watch the game now it looks like UW vs Cal.  Washington beat the shit out of Oregon like 71-20 that game.  We had won 12 straight over them before that, making that a hugely significant win for UW.  I'm convinced we did that tribute that week so that it looked like Cal getting stomped when that game that broke the winning streak gets replayed.\n",

      "When Disney was swallowing Fox they realized that the Fox Sports channels were a problem. They were making big money but that was about to end as their broadcast rights contracts were expiring and the affiliated teams were looking for big price increases. So Disney got the federal government to “force” the new behemoth to divest itself of the regional sports networks.  In walks the dumbasses at Sinclair. They have no clue about the expiring contracts and scoop up what to them looks like some valuable channels. They don't want to take on all of the debt necessary so they bring in Entertainment Studios, Inc to share ownership. Together they form Diamond Sports Group to run the networks and sell the naming rights to Bally. The casino people aren't actually responsible for any of this. They just pay to get their name run through the mud.   So DSG tries to put together an app to sell games to people and does a shitty job of it. Meanwhile they try to renegotiate the broadcast rights and it's costing them an arm and a leg. Maybe that's why there was no money for a decent app.   In any case, DSG filed for bankruptcy back in March. It has been missing payments to various sports teams and is being sued and is itself suing lots of organizations including its own parent company Sinclair Broadcast Group.   DSG **did** work out a deal with the NBA though. Assuming the agreement is approved by the bankruptcy judge they will pay teams less than agreed to and in return those teams will be able to sell 10 games to local TV channels and all contracts with NBA teams will be terminated at the end of the season.\n",
      "What a great summary of a horrible company.  Do you work in the broadcast business or something?\n",
      "No I just hate media consolidation in general and Sinclair Broadcast Group in particular.\n",

      "Simmons and others have kicked around the \"would Detroit try a reset and just take Cade?\" But I haven't seen anyone address the possibility of Cade demanding to be traded before the deadline.  This isn't just the worst team in league history _ they look like they are years away from being even remotely good. Surely Cade sees this. It would be entirely understandable if he said \"this is my third season and we're obviously getting worse, with no vision for improvement. I'm not wasting my career here.\"\n",
      "What if he's the first guy to take the qualifying offer? He's been on the right trajectory to earn a max as of late and by all accounts he is hypercompetitive.    In a different situation I think he could average like 20-5-5, maybe 55% from 2, 35% from 3, and one less turnover. And that's without growth from his current skill level.   His #1 pick salary means his fifth-year QO would be like $18M for 2025-26. At a 25% max his 5 additional years project to start at like $38M, but he'd keep over $5M in taxes in years 2-5 if he were to sign for a team in, say, his home state of Texas.\n",

      "Didn’t know about wiseman til he was with the warriors, how on earth did he even get drafted as the 2nd overall?\n",
      "It's a two-factor situation. For the most part, Wiseman's decision not to play college basketball after his suspension was up kept him a total mystery. The only real basketball film he had was high school footage as a 7 footer _ of course he looked special in that. Frankly, Warriors did *NOT* do their research properly because his college footage is UGLY. The first (and only) decent college team he played in his 3 games, he looked like he did as a rookie _ uncoordinated, lost in a 5v5 situation, inefficient scorer, terrible defender, etc.  The other issue is this was a COVID draft. Warriors really only got to give him a workout and see how he looked in an open gym. I get this is normal, but I don't believe they were allowed to try him out in some 3v3 or 5v5 practice to get a feel for him. In an open gym, he hit his shots and jumped out of the gym. But none of that is useful in an NBA game if the athleticism isn't functional (he jumps high but is slow to jump and cannot jump in quick succession, he sprints fast but no lateral quickness, etc) and you can't hit a shot in a game (bad FT shooter, inefficient 3pt shooter, truly disastrous mid-range shooter).  Warriors just had an owner obsessed with wanting a talent HE could say he developed and just ignored the writing on the wall.\n",

Sure you won't find star, but Pistons already have Cade, you need to start building the support, not finding another star by signing these athletic player that don't know how to play basketball.\n",
      "Yeah, that would require the capability to admit your mistakes, and also the ability to develop talent and put players in a position to succeed on the floor…none of which are going to happen.   They can’t even develop the young core they have, much less a bunch of UDFAs.\n",

He has no idea what he’s doing out there despite being in the league since 2020 and fouls the shit out of everyone.   He played 12 mins. 0 points, 2 rebounds, a turnover and 2 fouls and a -11. He shouldn’t see any daylight. Ever. Monty for some reason has a kink going 10-12 deep on a team that doesn’t have that much talent to pull it off. It’s insane.\n",
      "Monty for whatever reason loves playing 10-12 man rotations regardless of team depth. Last year with the Suns he had no idea what his best line-up was in the playoffs and kept changing up his lineups.\n",

It’s just so much more heightened on a team like the Pistons that it is so much fucking worse.   I haven’t seen a coach do this much appalling shit in awhile. It’s impressive.\n",

Eveyone knows about Wiseman, Bagley, Knox, and to have them all together, seems counterproductive for a young team; Like this is the last stop on the train of despair.

      "I remember in 2010, North Korea played in their first Fifa World Cup since 1966. In the first game, they came up against 5 time World Champions Brazil. To try and maintain North Korea’s ‘greatness’ to its people they didn’t broadcast the match locally as they realized it would be a humiliation. In a complete and utter shock they were only beaten 2-1 in a close match.  Three days later they played Portugal and due to the result against Brazil they decided that this game should be broadcast throughout North Korea as they had performed so brilliantly against Brazil. Portugal would beat them by a humiliating scoreline of 7-0, which did not go down well with Kim Jong Il.   Upon their return to North Korea the players were subjected to a 6 hour barrage of criticism in front of 400 people by a government official. Their coach was then sentenced to 6 months of hard labour for his failures by Kim Jong Il. I remember thinking what a terribly unjust and over the top reaction to what ultimately was only a game. One in which they were helplessly out of their depth in contrast to the teams they were playing.  It is only after having watched this game that I finally fully empathize with Kim Jong Il's decision and I would like to offer him a full and unreserved apology for criticizing those actions.\n",

      "Don’t let anybody fool you. This isn’t a completely hopeless group of players. They aren’t good, but they’re playing with hustle and a lot of them have real potential. This is hopeless coaching and a hopeless organization. Monty Williams should not be managing a McDonalds.   Let Cade get some spacing. Let the team get some threes up so shooting, playmaking, and good spacing develop. You can’t draw plays in the modern NBA without looking for a triple at least 1/3 of the time. Pick up a shooter or two and run a 2023 league offense. Doesn’t matter if you lose by fucking 40 because at least Cade gets to make the right play and Ivey and Ausar get in game reps to help fix their shit.   The streak will probably continue.

The sixers roster had Roco, Jerami Grant, Nerlens Noel, Tj mcconnell, ish smith... all guys who carved out NBA roles. They had 0 cohesion and no true star in the making.

      "Roster wise, the 2014-15 sixers were worse than the 2015-16 team. We were just signing 10 day contacts every other week to joe schmo   Random dudes with forgettable names:  Drew Gordan Chris Johnson  Malcolm Lee Malcolm Thomas  I have no memory of those players   We had another dude named furkan (aldemir) who was complete ass but started 10 games for us. Korkmaz is a god compared to him.   BYU legend brandon davies who averaged 6 points for us. Then we traded him mid season and brett brown was mad about that.   Kj McDaniels was a dunk highlight but didn't want to play for us. Traded him before the deadline to the rockets and his career didn't really go anywhere.  Javale freaking Mcgee. That dude traveled every other possession. No idea how the warriors developed that shaqtin highlight.   Assorted point guards: Isaiah Canaan _ cool name for when he hit threes, trash on defense) Alexey schved _ poor man's Rubio or something Tim Frazier _ he got assists but overrated AF  MCW _ ROY prior year, traded him  Tony wroten _ fan favorite, he was playable  Ish smith _ was good but we were dumb enough to pass on signing him again in the off-season and were forced by Adam silver to trade two 2nd rounders the next year so we would win a couple games  Glenn Robinson iii was a rookie and didn't do anything  Henry Sims. SIM CITY! He could hit some jumpshots from time to time. Don't remember much else.  Thomas Robinson was alright. Bully ball guy.   Jakarr sampspn was alright but had no business starting the number of games he did.   45 year old Jason Richardson hobbling down the court.   Luc bah a moute was good and I will always love him for the embiid connection   Roco and Nerlens were good.   Jermari grant was really underdeveloped and kinda underperformed given his draft stock and the amount of playing time he got.\n",
      "2014-15 Sixers were far more fun and had significantly better vibes than 2015-16, hell it was more enjoyable than last year when we won 54 games.  Okafor made 15-16 shitty. The best thing about the season was TJ.\n",

      "With the caveat that anybody can get hot or cold on any given night, I think Detroits best chance is 12/30, a home game against Toronto.  After that, another winnable game against Houston on New Years, and Utah on 1/3 but those are away games. Then, if they are still winless when they walk into DC, they will have a good look on 1/15. But in the event that doesn't work either, they really should take care of business against the wizards at home on 1/27.  They could win against SA on 1/10 but that is their SEGABABA and also 3 in 4 nights.  Thank you Detroit for giving me a reason to care about regular season basketball again lol\n",

      "This Detroit team is different. The way they play outside basically Duren and Cade is an affront to basketball as a sport Lol  But for real the amount of stupid self-inflicted stuff they do to themselves and how bad they shot in general will make it incredibly hard for a team like the Celtics to lose to them. Cade will have to go for like 50+ for them to really have a shot IMO\n",

In hockey, I remember r/canucks was going on about how the memes would be if the Canucks were going to be the first team to lose to the San Jose Sharks (who were having one of the worst starts to a season in NHL history).  Suffice it to say, the Canucks beat the Sharks by a score of 10-1.  The Sharks then lost 10-2 to the Penguins in their next game (becoming the first NHL team in almost 60 years to give up 10 goals in back to back games).

      "This must be the worst bench in NBA history. The starting 5 are bad, look like a young inexperienced starting 5 with some promise. But the bench? Despicable. Generational lack of touch from the bigs. All time low basketball IQ, relentlessly stupid turnovers, empty possessions. Wiseman, Knox and Bagley are absolutely not NBA players, and Sasser wouldn't be getting minutes at this stage for a remotely serious team.

In previous years, Cory Joseph would come in off the bench and accidentally lead us to a win when we were trying to tank. And guys like Mason Plumlee and Kelly Olynyk weren’t going to carry us to a title, but they could at least come in and play mistake-free basketball for a stretch.\n",

      "The thing is that we all knew those players were bad. The teams who drafted them would have loved nothing more than this players showing promise after the draft equity they spent on them but decided to move on from them. If they weren't top 10 picks no one would even know who they were\n",

      "And Grant was nowhere near the player he has been for the past 4 years. I remember RoCo being decent but I honestly don't remember much about the other two.\n",
      "Holmes was a rookie and didn't play much. He was buried behind Okafor and Noel. I remember claiming pretty early that year that Holmes was better than Okafor and should have gotten minutes over him but the team was never going to play a 2nd rounder over their 3rd overall pick, regardless of what the data suggested. I Tweeted something to that extent and Holmes' mom liked it.  McConnell surprisingly made the roster as the 15th man as an undrafted rookie and got big minutes early while Kendall Marshall was injured. He took the starting job from Isaiah Canaan a few games into the season for a bit and played well enough to stick around.  Covington might have been the best player on the roster that year but he would shine a lot more as an elite role player once Embiid started playing in future years.  Grant was very raw at the time, especially as a shooter. He was an awkward fit on a roster that already had too many non-shooting bigs and there wasn't a lot of evidence then that he'd become the shooter that he is now.\n",

      "Noel and Ish Smith were solid players on that roster too. Noel even got that 4 for 70 offer from the Mavs the next year. Christian Wood was briefly on that roster too as an undrafted rookie but became the first casualty of the Colangelo era.  There were two main issues with that roster:  1) The roster was incredibly young and most of the good or eventually good players were still in their first few years in the league.  2) Jahlil Okafor absolutely sank that team. Many fans saw the counting stats and saw a promising rookie, but the fact of the matter is that was one of the worst teams in NBA history and they were at their worst when he was on the court. Again, one of the worst teams in history was over 9 points worse when Okafor was on the floor. They forced a lot of two big lineups with Okafor and Noel which were predictably terrible.  They probably win more games and avoid worst team of all time territory if they abandoned the two big lineups, and just started Noel and played Holmes as the backup but ownership would never have allowed the optics of benching the third overall pick. Instead, they fed Okafor the ball all year and let him command the tank towards the #1 pick.\n",

Bucks fans were calling for bud to be fired for a while, that ring bought him extra years on his job until he got fired. However he was a good regular season coach.   Suns continued their 8-0 run from the bubble success but then were ultimately embarrassed as they lost a 2 -0 lead and 4 lost straight. Next year they were able to be the 1st seed but they got embarrassed by Luka. Obvious coaching issues. Along with the fact that ayton gave up (and reportedly had issues with Monty).  Both good teams but like with every finals run it requires a bit of luck. (Except lebron in the east he was a finals lock)\n",

      "Detroit Piston’s horrible season is arguably karma plus a prediction of when it will improve:  Having watches the MJ Netflix series it looks like Detroit was horrible to him.   This year is Chinese Astrology year of the Water Cat, a year that repeats once every 60 years. So last time was the year MJ was born.  I predict their ‘annus horribilis’ may be related to some karmic payback for past sins, and that it should improve with the new Chinese astrology year beginning in February.  For those who will post pissed anti astrology blah blah fyi I really don’t care any notifications are off\n",

      "Sasser, Ivey, Cunningham, Bogdanovic, and Duren.  Ivey can't shoot but the Pistons should expedite his timeline and see how committed he is to the roster by telling him he needs to sell out on the boards and on defense. Ivey should be tracking and beelining towards every shot attempt, on both sides of the ball. If he doesn't bring the necessary hustle energy, then Thompson takes his spot.   Pistons need more effort on the glass and everywhere in general.  They don't fight enough for loose balls and get enough second chance opportunities.\n",

If a Vegas over/under 27.5 win preseason team goes 2-27 with a 26 game losing streak and ends up with single digit wins, the HC should absolutely be fired.  His whole job is to win games. If he's won 2 games so far with a roster that should have won 8 games so far, then yeah he's been a horrible coach.  If he doesn't get fired, it's because of his contract or the Pistons playing significantly better.  Single digit wins for a season should get any HC fired.

Their best player statistically last year was Bojan and he started off the year injured.   Does that mean they were going to break the loss streak record? No, but I personally thought they were the worst team in the league coming into the year. I don’t think the Pistons are more talented than other all time bad teams, and using some idiot betters with an addiction on gambling isn’t the best way to make the argument. Betting stats has no real say and shouldn’t be used as evidence for which team is better or worse: to even know the numbers is a sign of degeneracy and of having a gambling addiction.\n",
      "Dude the betting thing was like 1 point out of 4 he made. You’re getting way too worked up over it.  Monty Williams was signed with that mega contract so he could max out the team’s potential- have them overperform.   That is why he’s getting heat. Nobody would care if it was a average contract salary wise.  Were those expectations justified? Obviously not, but that’s why the Pistons owner is getting more heat than anyone else.\n",
      "The roster is booty.   Seriously, let’s take a look at the Celtics. Not only do the Pistons not have anyone that would start over any player on the Celtics, it’s debateable if they have any player that would be 6th or 7th man on their roster over Horford and Hauser.   Spurs have Vassell, Wemby, and Johnson. Wizards have Kuzma, Jones, and Gafford. I think all 6 of those players would be the best player in Detroit if they were on that team, and those are players from the other 2 clear worst teams in the league.   Detroit seriously lacks talent.\n",
